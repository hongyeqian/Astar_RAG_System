[[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=0)] **Cleo Abram:** Introducing the conversation, referencing the "10 years of work" on the glasses, which someone on Mark Zuckerberg's team called the "real-life Tony Stark glasses." She mentions feeling optimistic about this platform in a world where AI is getting smarter. She also notes the challenge of maintaining social connection and missing physical touch like hugging her mother.

[[00:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=35)] **Cleo Abram:** Introducing the goal of the interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg: to figure out the future he is imagining, given the power he has over what the future might look like for nearly half the human population who use Meta products.

[[01:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=85)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Hey, good to meet you. Thanks for doing this. Yeah, looking forward to it.

[[01:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=86)] **Cleo Abram:** Explaining the goal for her series, "Huge if True," which is to explore potential technological futures, and her aim to help the audience see the future Mark Zuckerberg and the Meta team are building.

[[02:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=128)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Cool. All right, awesome. Let's do it.

[[02:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=133)] **Cleo Abram:** Starting with the ten years of work that culminated in the holographic glasses, and asking him to describe them, referencing the "real-life Tony Stark glasses" nickname.

[[02:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=142)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Describing the glasses as the first full holographic augmented reality glasses to exist in the world, the culmination of 10 years of R&D to miniaturize all the necessary computing. He explains that they are glasses—not a headset—that can place full holograms into the world with a wide field of view.

[[03:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=181)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Imagining a future where conversations can happen with a full-body hologram of a person, allowing for interaction like playing ping-pong, poker, or other holographic games. He believes this technology is the start of a "wild" future that will remake fields like work, science, education, and entertainment.

[[03:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=236)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Explaining that they are building these glasses because they will be the next major computing platform after phones. He highlights the trend in computing moving towards ubiquity, natural interaction, and social connectivity, moving away from the "unnatural" interaction of phones.

[[04:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=278)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Discussing the extreme miniaturization of the technology, mentioning key components packed into the frame, including:

- Micro projectors that shoot light into wave guides, a specialized display system.
- Nano etchings across the wave guides that catch the light to create Holograms.
- Eye tracking and cameras to synchronize the Holograms with where the user is looking.
- The necessary computing, batteries, microphones, and speakers.
- Sensors to map the physical world, allowing Holograms to be placed accurately.

[[06:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=360)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Adding that the complexity comes from syncing holographic images between the two displays (for each eye), handling physical movement, and integrating communication radios and the wrist-based neural interface.

[[06:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=409)] **Cleo Abram:** Asking Mark Zuckerberg to organize the current technology landscape, which includes heads-up display (HUD) glasses, Facebook's Ray-Ban Meta glasses, Quest, and Apple Vision Pro, and how he sees people using these tools.

[[07:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=453)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Explaining that the full holographic glasses are the "ultimate product" and the "science fiction future" they are developing towards. He outlines three different long-term product lines based on their journey:

1. **Display-less Glasses (like Ray-Ban Meta):** These will continue to improve for AI interaction (talking to it, getting voice responses) and will be permanently more affordable.
2. **Heads-Up Display Glasses:** A middle-tier product with a smaller field of view (20-30°), not suitable for full holograms, but great for seeing AI responses, getting directions, or texting via the neural interface (since people read faster than they listen).
3. **Full Holographic AR Glasses:** The most premium and expensive, but still hoped to be generally accessible.

[[09:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=592)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Adding that mixed reality headsets (like Quest) will also remain important because they can always fit more compute than glasses, allowing high-quality, high-resolution mixed reality to be delivered affordably.

[[11:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=663)] **Cleo Abram:** Asking how the future feels when combining the hardware (glasses, Quest) with the Llama AI models.

[[11:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=684)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Identifying the two primary values they are trying to bring:

1. **Presence:** A deep feeling of being physically present with another person that is the "Holy Grail" of social platforms.
2. **Personalized AI:** Intelligence that has context from the user's life and what is physically happening around them. He notes that glasses are the ideal form factor for this, as they can see what you see and hear what you hear.

[[13:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=794)] **Cleo Abram:** Expressing her own optimism about presence, saying she looks forward to feeling like she's playing Scrabble with her mother who lives far away. She then asks about the challenge of physical connection, stating she still misses the feeling of hugging her mom, and asks how Meta addresses eye contact and physical touch.

[[14:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=885)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Stating they will achieve eye contact long before physical touch (haptics). He notes haptics is difficult, but they are making progress, focusing on hands first as the most important sensory area. He mentions demos like feeling a digital ping-pong ball hit a virtual paddle via a controller. He calls force feedback (needed for activities like virtual Jiu-Jitsu) the "hardest thing" but believes they will get there over time, emphasizing that the platform will provide a realistic sense of presence for most things people want to do.

[[16:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1018)] **Cleo Abram:** Asking what aspect of building presence is most fascinating to him.

[[17:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1024)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Explaining that presence is an "illusion," and it's less about one thing providing the sense of presence and more about *anything* done wrong breaking it (e.g., low field of view, bad physics, latency). He notes that what people can accept as real is interesting, citing the ability to mix photorealistic codec avatars with cartoony worlds, as long as the avatars move with "authentic mannerisms."

[[20:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1216)] **Cleo Abram:** Shifting the topic to social connection, citing data that the average American has fewer friends and spends less time socializing in person (a nearly 30% drop over 20 years for adults, 70% for young adults). She notes that Americans are struggling to connect despite all the tools.

[[21:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1297)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Arguing that the decline in social capital predates modern technology, citing economic and social trends. He states that digital connection is not replacing a better physical connection, but is *unlocking more* connection, since people already want more friends than they have. He believes AR glasses will let him spend more time with distant family, and that the loss of social capital has deeper roots than just online interaction.

[[24:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1448)] **Cleo Abram:** Discussing AI on a spectrum: beneficial struggles that are removed (like universal translation) versus struggles that build a "muscle" (like articulating emotions). She asks where the line is drawn to ensure human "muscles" are stronger, not weaker, in the future.

[[26:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1601)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Contending that people will always find new things to struggle with, and AI will simply raise the bar. He uses coding as an analogy: in the future, AI will let kids easily describe and build complex software, but their struggle will shift to expressing their creativity and editing to get exactly what they want. He believes learning foundational skills like coding and languages remains important because they teach a rigorous way to think.

[[31:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1880)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Mentioning that the new Ray-Ban Meta glasses will enable real-time translation just by wearing them while traveling.

[[31:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1904)] **Cleo Abram:** Asking how generative AI changes how social media feels, with potential for AI-generated text, images, and AI influencers.

[[32:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=1931)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Stating that AI will accelerate the existing shift on social media towards consuming content from creators and non-friends. AI will enable:

- **User-generated content:** Friends creating funnier content, or AI automatically editing users' captured footage into interesting posts.
- **System-generated content:** Personalized content purely generated by AI, such as funny items or summaries, specifically for the user.
- **AI Creators:** Creators building AI "artifacts" of themselves, like an "interactive sculpture," that their community can interact with when the creator is unavailable, helping to manage unlimited demand.

[[35:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2132)] **Cleo Abram:** Expressing her own worry and generalized fear about the pace of change, asking which concerns he feels are most legitimate versus most misunderstood.

[[36:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2178)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Acknowledging that the pace of change creates uncertainty and anxiety. He notes that while new tools will lead to better work and lives, it is every individual's responsibility to keep up or risk being out-competed. He says the quality of work will "go through the roof" due to AI, which creates natural anxiety about facing big, unknown changes.

[[37:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2260)] **Cleo Abram:** Asking for advice for a young person starting a career and family in this future.

[[38:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2290)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Advising to **maintain curiosity**. He cautions against overstating how different the next decade will be, reminding that the last 10–15 years (internet, smartphones) also brought dramatic change. He believes the people who do well are those who are generally curious and embrace the technology to improve their lives, rather than fighting it.

[[39:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2359)] **Cleo Abram:** Asking about the debate surrounding **Open Source AI** and its impact on the development of AI.

[[39:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2380)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Contrasting Meta's open source approach (Llama) with the "one AI" vision (like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT). He argues the world will have a lot of different AI systems, much like there are many different apps and websites, and every business will eventually have its own AI. He advocates for open source because it allows everyone to take and modify the model, leading to diversity.

[[41:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2475)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Addressing the safety debate, which suggests closed models are safer by keeping them out of the hands of "bad developers." He argues the opposite, citing the history of open source software: it is generally **safer and more secure** because widespread scrutiny finds and fixes security issues quicker, leading to a smarter, safer model for everyone.

[[43:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2615)] **Cleo Abram:** Asking for the biggest open, genuine question on his mind, specifically concerning the combination of AI and hardware.

[[44:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2655)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Focusing on the question of the **scaling limits of current AI methods** (Transformer architectures). He explains that historically, AI hits a plateau, but the new architectures have not found the end yet. He asks how far this scaling can continue (e.g., Llama 3 on tens of thousands of GPUs to Llama 5 scaling even further). He acknowledges the risk—it could hit an asymptote—but he is betting **hundreds of billions of dollars** on the continued advancement of the fundamental AI for quite a while, which will drive new products and keep the technology landscape dynamic.

[[46:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2807)] **Cleo Abram:** Thanking Mark Zuckerberg.

[[46:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI&t=2814)] **Mark Zuckerberg:** Thank you.
