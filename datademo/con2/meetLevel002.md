### Capability Highlights (by org)

**META**

- Completed 10 years of R&D for the **first full holographic AR glasses**.
- Key innovations: micro projectors, nano-etched waveguides, dual-eye hologram synchronization, neural wrist interface, spatial sensors, and onboard compute miniaturization.
- Structured three product tiers:
  - **Display-less Ray-Ban Meta Glasses:** AI voice interface, affordable everyday use.
  - **Heads-Up Display Glasses:** Smaller field of view, optimized for reading AI outputs and notifications.
  - **Full Holographic AR Glasses:** Premium device enabling immersive holographic experiences.
- Integration of **Llama AI** to provide context-aware, multimodal intelligence.
- Core design philosophy focused on **presence** (human-like co-location) and **personalized AI** (contextual understanding). 

------

### Current Projects / Workstreams

- **Full Holographic AR Glasses:** Advanced prototype stage; culmination of a decade-long R&D effort to miniaturize full computing systems.
- **Ray-Ban Meta Glasses:** Commercial rollout in progress, bringing AI-assisted wearables to mass market.
- **Neural Wrist Interface:** Research focused on interaction and input, such as enabling texting via the interface. (Haptics are a separate, difficult challenge Meta is also researching, focusing first on hands).
- **Llama AI Integration:** Expanding multimodal understanding for real-time translation and personal context. 

------

### Overlaps vs. Unique Contributions

- **Overlaps:** Shared goals with other companies (e.g., Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest) around immersive computing and presence.
- **Unique to META:**
  - Open-source-first AI philosophy through Llama.
  - **Focus on the illusion of presence**, emphasizing that "authentic mannerisms" are key to this feeling, while **also** valuing high-compute and high-resolution experiences (like on Quest) as an important, affordable product line.
  - Vision of AR glasses as the next **social platform**, not just a productivity tool. 

------

### Proposed Collaboration Path

- **Fast Track:** Integrate Llama AI with AR devices to enable real-time multimodal understanding (speech, vision, spatial context).
- **Research Track:** Continue haptic feedback and neural interface experiments to simulate realistic presence and touch.
- Explore co-learning models between humans and AI where automation strengthens, rather than replaces, cognitive “muscles.” 

------

### Decisions

- **00:02:22** – Meta will continue to position **full holographic AR glasses** as the next major computing platform after smartphones.
- **00:39:40** – Commit to **open-source AI strategy** with Llama; oppose monopolistic single-AI approaches.
- **00:44:15** – Approve large-scale investment (hundreds of billions of dollars) in AI scaling, accepting potential architectural plateaus. 

------

### Risks / Open Issues

- **Haptic realism:** Achieving convincing physical feedback remains a major technical challenge.
- **AI scalability:** Unknown upper bounds for current Transformer architectures may cap future performance.
- **Social disconnection:** Persistent decline in in-person socialization despite more digital tools.
- **User anxiety:** Broad societal unease about job relevance and adaptation to accelerating AI change. 

------

### Action Items

-  Advance research into **force-feedback haptics** for immersive realism (Due: TBD)
-  Expand **Llama AI open-source community** to support global developer participation (Due: TBD)
-  Deliver **mid-tier affordable AR HUD glasses** for mainstream consumers (Due: TBD)
-  Continue **AI scaling and efficiency investigations** on Transformer-based architectures (Due: TBD)
