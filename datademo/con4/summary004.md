# Summary

Nimi Mehta, CEO of Speaker by Nimi Mehta, detailed her career journey from an early **MTV presenter** role that ended unexpectedly, forcing a realization that goals are merely **markers along the journey**. She successfully rebuilt her career in Abu Dhabi and Dubai by employing **persistence** (e.g., showing up with physical CVs), the **power of visualization**, and the conscious choice of leaving a comfortable job to avoid feeling **stagnant and undervalued**. She introduced several core concepts for self-alignment: the **5-second rule** for prioritizing gut instinct over rational fear; the **Voice Layer Theory** for identifying and shedding external influences that **dilute** one's authentic voice; and the belief that **assertiveness** is achieved by being **kind yet clear and concise** about boundaries and responding rather than reacting to conflict. She advised listeners to track achievements using a **"My Wins"** list or photo album to manage self-doubt.
