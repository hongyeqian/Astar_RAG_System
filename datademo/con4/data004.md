[[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=0)] **Host:** All right, Balances, today's guest is someone I'm really excited to have on the show because, you know, when you just come across those profiles on Instagram and you're just magnetically drawn to someone... I feel like we almost have similar neural pathways in our brain, we think about things in a very similar way. So I think this is going to be a very synergistic, easy conversation. Our guest is the CEO of Speaker by **Nimi Mehta**. She's a TV and radio presenter, an MC, a podcast host, a speaker, a public speaking mentor. What don't you do? It's the beautiful Nimi Mehta on the podcast today, welcome to the show.

[[00:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=41)] **Nimi Mehta:** Thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here and to to synergize with you.

[[00:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=44)] **Host:** Oh, I love it. There's going to be a lot of synergizing, I think. One of the first things that I was really interested in was your journey from completing your degree in journalism and getting your first job, which you have described as being your dream job at the time, and just that first year experience and what happened directly after, because I think that's important context to understand kind of where you've come to now.

[[01:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=77)] **Nimi Mehta:** Yeah, that's a great first question. I did journalism at University, came straight out at the age of 21, and got the job to be an **MTV presenter**. And that for me just felt so normal at the time. When something like that happens to you, you think that life is that easy, especially at such a young age. I got the gig through an online competition where I submitted a video reel. I really produced, directed, and presented in that. But it was just what followed after. I really thought at that age that you have one goal post, you get to that goalpost, and then it's over. Obviously it wasn't. And it was a real hit to the ego. I realized that my dreams are ever evolving and ever changing, and sometimes when you think something is your dream, it's not—it's just a stepping stone towards the bigger picture.

[[03:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=188)] **Host:** I think we've forgotten one key detail though. So you got the job at MTV, and then what happened that shattered your ego?

[[03:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=198)] **Nimi Mehta:** Well, I was there for a year, and then the contract ended, and I was unemployed for a few years after that trying to hustle back in to be a presenter.

[[03:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=208)] **Host:** So they just didn't renew it?

[[03:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=209)] **Nimi Mehta:** Yeah, they didn't renew it. The channel concept they created, like District MTV, just wasn't picking up, so they ended it all. And that was me done.

[[03:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=223)] **Host:** What a beautiful lesson to learn at such a young age that your dreams are ever evolving and that goals are just **markers along your journey**. It helps you enjoy the process. When you really zoom out all the way, you realize that's actually what life is. I had a similar experience where I thought that achieving a goal was going to feel a certain way, and it felt great, but then it was over, and it was like, "Okay, now what's the next part of life?" It's good to have had that reframe where you're like, "Okay, my goals are actually just markers of what's next."

[[04:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=293)] **Nimi Mehta:** No one teaches us this. Life does, and these experiences teach you. I just think we need to know that **we are never ever the finished product**. That's what I was always chasing as a young individual. I thought, "Oh, overnight they were successes," but I think it built my character a lot more.

[[05:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=339)] **Host:** So you were saying you were unemployed for a few years, and then what was the next thing, and how did you work out how to get to that place after being a little disappointed in that initial dream?

[[05:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=349)] **Nimi Mehta:** I really believe in the **power of proximity**. I thought, even though I was let go at MTV, they are under Viacom, and within Viacom they have brands like Nickelodeon. I thought, "I'm going to try and get a job at any of these companies, as long as I'm in the building." I thought someone would remember me or I would hear whispers of a new job. So I applied for an advert scheduler job at Nickelodeon. It was so monotonous, and nothing came of it. But I never lost sight, I never gave up hope. I also went through a **process of elimination**. I realized I should learn every single role possible within the media industry, 'cuz I might love being a producer or a director more than a presenter. I tried everything: editorial at my local newspaper, to *Hello* magazine, to an internship with ITV. I was so persistent with every work experience job. Back then, it was literally **showing up at the door with physical paper CVs**. I got one of my internships because a producer was not responding to my emails, and I just kept going—once a month for six to eight months. He finally said, "You are so persistent. Something's just come up." So, if you set your eyes on something, just keep going. Then I realized TV presenting is what I want to do, so I went into radio, as there was a lack of opportunity in TV in the UK. I went to a local radio station and did that for five months. I was shockingly bad. But five months later, I moved to **Radio 1 Abu Dhabi to host a national breakfast show**. That was a crazy journey for me, going from like a thousand people to a whole nation.

[[09:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=565)] **Host:** Wow. You never know, every little thing has its role and leads you to exactly where you're meant to be. I'll share one thing that really helped me continue to be persistent: imagine you knew you had **50 "Nos" before you got a "Yes."** You'd be going as fast as you could to churn through all those. Seeing every rejection or setback as just, "That's one less one before my opportunity," has been a really great reframe for me to just keep going and not take it personally.

[[10:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=645)] **Host:** So then you've gone into this Abu Dhabi role, and now you're in this entrepreneurial freelancing. What have been the biggest things you've learned in that transition?

[[11:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=666)] **Nimi Mehta:** I did radio in Abu Dhabi for a year, until **Channel 4 poached me over to Dubai**. I was at Channel 4 hosting the breakfast show for five years. We were named the number one show in the country. The power of **visualization and manifestation is real**. I cannot stress it enough; it is one of the key things that got me to where I am today. I remember sitting there in my bed when I was unemployed and miserable, looking at the Channel 4 presenter lineup, just staring and visualizing myself in that lineup. And I kept saying, "You're going to be there." It happened literally a few years later. That was my dream job. I was lucky that my co-host and I had a 50/50 share, rather than the classic radio setup where females were "giggle girls." But it got to a point where I felt it in my bones: "It is time for a change." The question I asked myself was: **"Which fear do I choose?"** The first fear was leaving my solid salary, comfort zone, and letting go of my "dream." The second fear was, **"Are you still going to be here in five years time, feeling undervalued and miserable?"** That fear outweighed the fear before. I was so scared of staying stagnant that the fear about leaving was irrelevant. I would rather look back and say, "I'm so proud you tried."

[[15:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=900)] **Host:** That is such a powerful question. A similar question is: **Which discomfort do you want to choose?** It's uncomfortable not pursuing things you dream about, and it's also uncomfortable pursuing them because you deal with self-doubt and uncertainty. But the flip is never trying and being stuck in something that is not setting your heart on fire. If you get that feeling in your bones, you have to acknowledge what's going on. Getting raw with yourself is the most actionable thing.

[[16:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=978)] **Nimi Mehta:** 100%. Your **body tells you exactly what you want**. We talk about listening to our mind and heart, but our body is so aligned. I have a **5-second rule**: as soon as I feel something, I hold on to that, because in five seconds, my mind's going to start convincing me otherwise. It will bring up money, stability, and all the extras that don't contribute to your core. Hold on to that core gut feeling. A lot of us ignore it because it's the easiest thing to do. That kind of discipline has really changed the game for me in decision making.

[[17:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=1061)] **Host:** That's amazing. Sitting with the thought for five seconds and just noticing that knee-jerk reaction is a good actionable thing people can practice to start listening to that inner voice. My fiancé, a former chiropractor, used to talk about how the body's language was **pain**. For me, if I'm stressed or out of alignment, I always get neck pain. I think just tuning into little things, whether it's in moments of stress or change, getting familiar with how you respond in your body is so powerful.

[[19:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=1175)] **Nimi Mehta:** That also applies to when you meet people. My body instantly tells me if I am the vibe for that person or not. Usually, even when my body tells me they're not my vibe, I start doubting myself rather than doubting the other person. We need to trust ourselves more. We get into bad friendships or relationships because we are not following our gut. That level of self-awareness is key.

[[20:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=1221)] **Host:** One thing that helped me get comfortable with that is realizing it's not about good or bad, it's just **alignment**. Our energies are just not aligned, and I don't need to give you more than what I have to. I'd love to ask you about **finding your voice**. What does that actually mean? How do people go about locating what that even is for them?

[[21:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=1290)] **Nimi Mehta:** It started when I shifted from my radio job to **legacy mode**: "What am I leaving behind?" I thought about how I used to be an absolute mute as a child, and now I'm a presenter. I realized what I had taught myself I could **framework** and teach people to do in less time. That's when I created **The Voice Layer Theory**. When you're born, your parents are the biggest influence. On top of that are teachers, then media, and now millions of voices on social media. All these layers are building on top of us, and our own voice is getting **diluted**. Our voice is its own nucleus and our greatest asset, but we haven't done the groundwork to identify it. I did two things:

1. **Isolate my voice:** I took myself away for a week—a social media detox—and started **questioning everything**. Every decision, thought, and opinion: "Why did I choose that?" That's the only way to break through and realize what the source is. I even had an identity crisis questioning if I did journalism because my mom wanted me to.
2. **Evaluate the voices around me:** I identified the five closest people to me and whether they were a positive influence, enhancing my voice, or dimming it. I had to be cutthroat because I have to **protect my voice at all costs**. As Gary Vee said, "**I found my voice in the trenches of other voices.**" Then you rebuild the voices around you with people who enhance your voice. Finding your voice is an **ever-evolving journey**.

[[28:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=1733)] **Host:** That is so powerful. I love the step of critically analyzing, **"Who are those five people?"** and extending that to **"What content am I consuming online?"** This is the ultimate blueprint for alignment in life—to get down to the source of why you have certain beliefs or struggle with setting boundaries. I had a similar experience in Greece for my sister's wedding where I drank more than usual and realized how **detached I was from myself**. My intuition was nowhere to be found. Ever since, I'm hyper-aware that **alcohol disconnects me from my own voice**.

[[32:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=1920)] **Nimi Mehta:** I resonate with that because every time I go home and I'm surrounded by people who know the old me, **I regress**. I go back to that little, insecure, timid girl, and then I have to almost relearn myself when I return to Dubai. This shows you should be conscious of the things you consume, whether it's people or substances.

[[33:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2037)] **Host:** I asked you what you'd been ruminating on, and one thing that stood out was the difference between being **nice and being assertive**. I struggled with this as a people pleaser, where I wasn't assertive when I should have stood up for myself. Is there a happy medium?

[[35:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2104)] **Nimi Mehta:** I had to completely dissolve the idea that my only two options were being nice or being mean. Especially as a woman and entrepreneur, I felt uncomfortable. My parents raised me just to "be a good person." But in the media industry, I struggled, especially when a hairdresser on set told me, "**You need to stop being so nice. You need to be a bit of a bitch around here to be respected**." I realized the people who navigate the industry that way operate from **fear**, not respect. That's not what I want. I've figured out that **you can still be kind, but still be very clear and concise about what it is that you want.** I got muddled thinking I couldn't be clear because I didn't want to be labeled a "Diva" or "difficult," which happens to women so easily. The balance is stopping myself from being a "yes" person. A quality of a highly confident person is the ability to **respond and not react**. Responding means taking your time, not waffling, and treating your **words like gold**. I've learned the hard way that being too nice means people walk all over you and take advantage.

[[39:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2382)] **Host:** Being assertive doesn't mean being mean; it means **communicating your boundaries**. People pleasing is saying "yes" to someone else and "no" to yourself. If you strip down to the source, why do you feel the need to put someone else's comfort above your own? If I had responded to conflict in the moment, it would have been reactive and emotional. Taking my time and responding in a way that's aligned for me feels right. But sometimes that means saying nothing, which is me being too nice. It comes down to **delivery** and ensuring you assert yourself in a way that is authentic to you.

[[42:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2542)] **Nimi Mehta:** It goes back to **"Am I reacting or responding?"** Even in professional settings, we feel pressured to answer straight away. Just **take a beat, take a breath**. Say, "I'm not quite clear on that. Let me get back to you," because **your words have value**. We also need to remember that **relationships are everything**. I never want someone to walk away from an interaction with me and feel horrible. I'm conscious of treating everyone—from crew to director—the same. You want to leave a good impression, but also protect yourself at the same time.

[[44:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2658)] **Host:** When you come across personalities that have that "doggy dog" world attitude, you don't need to match their energy. This is why **finding your own voice** is so important. If you're aligned and centered in your own voice, you just respond authentically. It's all about that **regular check-in**, which I do through spending time alone or meditation. Do you have an outlet?

[[45:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2722)] **Nimi Mehta:** I live in my **notes app** and a lot of **photo albums**. When I'm having doubts, I have a photo album called **My Wins**. I take photos of tiny things to hosting big events. I skim through those photos and say, "**You did that.** No one else did it, you did it." It's my reminder album to see how far I've come. I also talk about **loud confidence versus soft confidence**. The loudest person in the room is not the most confident. I call myself an extrovert-introvert; I'm the most confident in my introvert mode. When I see someone who is super loud, I have compassion for them, because there is something deeper there. We don't have to be the loudest in the room to be the most confident.

[[47:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2869)] **Host:** I have an **Excel sheet**—very corporate of me—with a wins list. Once you know you are filling something out, you start looking for those things to be grateful for or proud of yourself for. That builds your confidence. If you are feeling low in self-confidence, **sit with it**. Don't push yourself through it; **move with it**. I gave myself 24 hours this week to sit with feeling rubbish. You'll feel great tomorrow, and you'll be grateful for the rise up.

[[49:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=2967)] **Nimi Mehta:** **Emotions are all temporary**. Nothing lasts forever. Just feel it, let it do its thing. You need the lows, because it's a point of reference for the high moments. Everything serves its purpose. My therapist taught me to have a **cookie jar** (or an album of wins) where you track and look to see what you're proud of yourself for today, this week, this month.

[[50:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=3035)] **Host:** I think this is a beautiful place to leave our conversation. Thank you so much for your time.

[[50:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpltaOMFdc&t=3047)] **Nimi Mehta:** Thank you so much for having me, and I've absolutely loved this conversation. Thank you for your time.
