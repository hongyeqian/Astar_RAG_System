### Risks / Open Issues



- **Career volatility:** The "dream job" at MTV ended after one year when the contract was not renewed, leading to a "hit to the ego" and several years of unemployment.
- **Evolving goals:** Realization that goals are just "markers" and dreams are "ever evolving," rather than a single endpoint. Humans are "never ever the finished product".
- **Fear of stagnation:** The fear of "feeling undervalued and miserable" in 5 years at a stable job (CHANNEL4_DUBAI) outweighed the fear of leaving comfort and salary.
- **Dilution of voice:** External influences (parents, media, social media) build "layers" that dilute a person's authentic voice.
- **Environmental regression:** Risk of regressing to an "insecure, timid" version of oneself when surrounded by people who know the "old me".
- **Assertiveness vs. "Nice":** Struggled with the false binary of being "nice" (and walked over) or "mean". In media, women are easily labeled a "Diva" or "difficult" for being clear.
- **People Pleasing:** People pleasing is defined as saying "yes" to someone else and "no" to yourself.
- **Confidence Perception:** The loudest person in the room is often not the most confident; "soft confidence" is equally valid.
