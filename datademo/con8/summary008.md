# Summary

In the final episode of his WTF Podcast, Marc Maron speaks with President Barack Obama, beginning with a discussion on performance anxiety, which Obama compares to Bill Russell's pre-game nerves, before Maron has Obama witness a "pseudo-legal document" releasing his producer, Brendan McDonald, from his duties. Maron then expresses anxiety about his transition away from the show and the audience's reliance on him, prompting Obama to advise him to "take a beat," reflect, and find his "next highest and best use," similar to how Obama managed his own post-presidency by paying off his "deficit" with Michelle and moving from "player to coach" for the next generation. Obama reflects on being drawn back into politics due to his successor, and they discuss the evolution of digital media, with Obama contrasting his campaign's early, unifying use of the "Meetup" app (which forced in-person, complex interactions) with the "addictive" and polarizing nature of modern algorithms (like TikTok and "reels") that are "designed to make slot machines" and "break your brain." Obama defends the value of long-form, honest conversations, arguing leaders must "know what you really believe" and have a "moral compass." He cautions against progressive "scold" language and the "holier-than-thou" posturing, advocating for an acceptance of "partial victory" ("better is good")—citing the Affordable Care Act and a climate change anecdote involving his daughter Malia—and warning that cynicism leads to inaction. Finally, they confront the current state of democracy, which Obama states has had its norms "weakened deliberately," citing the politicization of the military (Posse Comitatus) and Justice Department. He argues that America is now being "tested," and that convictions that "don't cost anything" are just "fashion," urging people to stand up for "old-fashioned values" like character, honesty, and kindness, which have been overshadowed by a culture obsessed with wealth and fame.
