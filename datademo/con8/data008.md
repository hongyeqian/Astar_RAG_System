[[00:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=1)] **Marc Maron**: How you doing? Good buddy, how you doing? We've aged. I know, I'm a little hunched over, but you look [[00:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7)] like you're walking okay. How you doing, Mr. President? It's good to see you.

[[00:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7)] **Barack Obama**: Nice to see you. How you [[00:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=11)] been?

[[00:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=11)] **Marc Maron**: Well, you know, I'm... nice to meet you. How come he's in a suit, man? Everything else is in [[00:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=16)] the wash. Yeah, I know. Suit guy. Like, I had a when when you were first on, I was like, [[00:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=21)] "What am I going to wear?" And I'm like, "Well, I just wear the plaid shirt, I guess."

[[00:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=24)] **Barack Obama**: Well, you're [[00:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=25)] casual.

[[00:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=25)] **Marc Maron**: Yeah, I am. 'Cause 'cause I knew you would be here. I think this way. The, uh, got the...

[[00:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=31)] **Barack Obama**: Few basketballs? Well, uh, yeah, I'm signing them because I... we stuff gets stacked up that I'm supposed to sign.

[[00:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=37)] **Marc Maron**: Believe me. You remember my old garage, right? Yeah, it's it's it's it's similar. It's... yeah, a little neater, [[00:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=43)] but not much. Okay. Rolling on both. We're rolling on both. Good. Yeah, everything's good. Can I say before [[00:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=51)] we start, or...

[[00:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=51)] **Barack Obama**: Sure, you know, whenever you want to start. To me, I can't imagine anything tougher or more [[01:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=60)] terrifying than doing standup comedy. So, once you do that, yeah, I mean, everything else is is easy. I won't [[01:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=68)] say easy, I'm saying not as frightening.

[[01:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=69)] **Marc Maron**: Yeah, the the to me, standing alone on a stage and hoping [[01:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=77)] a bunch of people laugh at your stuff, yeah, it's uh, yeah, it you get used to it. Yeah, but...

[[01:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=81)] **Barack Obama**: Not unlike I'm sure, uh, your gig, uh, you know, sometimes it's not going to go exactly right. It's not [[01:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=90)] always going to, you're not always going to, uh, hit it out of the park, right?

[[01:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=94)] **Marc Maron**: But I guess what [[01:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=95)] I'm saying is at a certain point for you, there's got to be just you had a lot of reps.

[[01:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=99)] **Marc Maron**: Reps are helpful, man. Reps in talking to people and reps in comedy, but it's weird with both for me [[01:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=107)] because, uh, I I seem to get just as anxious and and and it never goes away. It's not for [[01:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=114)] me because I I I don't know if it's part of my preparation, but with standup it's a little less [0m 2s] [[02:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=121)] where like, I know that a part of me lives up there, that that that I exist on that stage [[02:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=128)] uh, and so I don't freak myself out as much. But with conversations, I I don't generally know what's going [[02:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=134)] to happen and the anxiety is different, but, uh, but yeah, I I still keep it fresh by being terrified.

[[02:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=140)] **Barack Obama**: Well, look, there's, uh, Bill Russell. Yep. Bill Russell, greatest, uh, greatest champion of North American sports, kept throwing [[02:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=151)] up even after, yeah, right before games. It's true. Right?

[[02:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=155)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you got to have a little [[02:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=157)] bit of a few butterflies. Otherwise, you don't get it. You know, not not just having a conversation [[02:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=166)] right? Um, you know, if if there's a big speech that I've got to give, yeah, um, then there's still [[02:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=173)] a little bit of a little bit of fear, a little bit of adrenaline, yeah, a little bit of like, [[02:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=177)] all right, let me make sure that, yeah, you know, I got, yeah, you're ready to go. You're focused. I'm [[03:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=183)] focused, lit up. I'm I'm pumped up.

[[03:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=188)] **Marc Maron**: Are are we are we just going to dive in here or how [[03:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=190)] you...

[[03:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=190)] **Marc Maron**: We're already doing it. We're already doing it. I do want to ask you, I got a weird question [[03:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=194)] I want to ask you, and I I decided to start with this as opposed to end with it, and [[03:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=197)] it's it's kind of business, but it's important for me, it's important for the show. I'm going to I'm going [[03:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=202)] to ask you to for your signature on something.

[[03:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=202)] **Barack Obama**: Absolutely. What do we got? Is it a commutation? I can't [[03:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=208)] do that anymore.

[[03:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=208)] **Marc Maron**: No, no. This is, uh, I I created this pseudo legal document to to honor this is [[03:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=214)] our last episode, and this is, uh, this is something I wrote, and I it's, uh, it's honest, but I [[03:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=220)] I I wanted to witness, and and you're here. So, to all concerned, this is dated 10/13/25, the date of [[03:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=227)] the last show. I, Marc Maron, hereby formerly release Brendan McDonald from the professional responsibility of listening to me talk [[03:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=236)] from now and in perpetuity. Brendan has listened to me talk no less than 10,000 hours over the last 22 [[04:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=243)] years, often several hours in one sitting. That's a lot, even more than I've listened to myself talk. Brendan is [[04:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=250)] free to talk to me socially, but that is entirely up to him, if if he chooses, if he chooses [[04:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=256)] to do so, I will be delighted and promise not to abuse the privilege. It has been a life-changing ride [[04:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=262)] on my yammering, and I am forever grateful to Brendan for keeping me at my best.

[[04:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=265)] **Barack Obama**: I I am I [[04:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=267)] am more than happy. I'm going to sign it, too. Sign it. I will witness it. And, uh, this is [[04:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=273)] kind of a commutation. I mean, essentially, Brendan is released.

[[04:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=277)] **Marc Maron**: Yes. It's a it's a...

[[04:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=277)] **Barack Obama**: From me, from you, you [[04:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=284)] know, I have a sense that, uh, he kind of liked hanging out with you.

[[04:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=287)] **Marc Maron**: Yeah, it was a it's [[04:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=290)] been a hell of a partnership. I mean, it may be a little Stockholm syndrome.

[[04:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=292)] **Barack Obama**: No, no. He...

[[04:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=294)] **Marc Maron**: He won't [[04:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=295)] let that happen. Yeah, I'm completely aware that I have not had that impact on his brain 'cause if I [[05:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=302)] did, we'd both be in trouble. He's like the better half. He's protected me. You know, I'll say shit, [[05:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=309)] and and and it'll go on. Uh, I'll record stuff, and in the back of my head, I'll think like, [[05:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=314)] Brendan's not going to he's not going to leave that in. No, not really. Yeah, it's...

[[05:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=318)] **Barack Obama**: Well, you got to [[05:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=319)] you got to have... he's like your super ego.

[[05:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=321)] **Marc Maron**: That's exactly right. And he's a a functioning part of my [[05:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=324)] memory. Yes. Like, I don't remember like, obviously, I remember our conversation, but there's been 1,600 and more, almost 1,700 [[05:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=332)] conversations. That's a lot.

[[05:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=333)] **Marc Maron**: So, how are you? So, so tell me how you're feeling. I look, congratulations. First of [[05:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=337)] all, congratulations. Second of all, I'm honored to be on your last show. How are you feeling about this whole [[05:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=344)] thing? Uh, transition, uh, moving on from this thing that has been, well, uh, one of the defining, uh, parts [[05:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=352)] of your career in 16 years, a long time.

[[05:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=354)] **Barack Obama**: I mean, well, I mean, I I maybe you you could [[05:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=358)] help me.

[[05:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=358)] **Marc Maron**: I I feel okay. I feel like I'm I'm sort of ready for the break, but, uh, but [[06:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=364)] there is sort of a a fear there of, uh, you know, what do we what do I do now? [[06:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=369)] I mean, I'm busy, but not unlike your job... I'm going to compare my job to the presidency now, is that [[06:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=375)] I think it's pretty similar.

[[06:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=376)] **Barack Obama**: Thank you.

[[06:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=377)] **Marc Maron**: I've got a lot of people who over the last 16 years have [[06:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=382)] grown to rely on me.

[[06:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=383)] **Barack Obama**: Yes. And you've got a lot of fans just around, yeah, and in unlikely places.

[[06:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=390)] **Marc Maron**: Oh, yeah. As in here, yeah.

[[06:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=393)] **Marc Maron**: The, uh, but like, you know, they they need something, right? That that there [[06:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=397)] is a a feeling of like, "How am I going to feel, you know, less alone? How am I going [[06:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=404)] to deal with my mental this or that? And and how am I going to find, you know, a way [[06:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=409)] to exist in the world that we're living in?" I mean, I'm not offering them solutions, but I am commiserating, [[06:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=415)] and it's comforting.

[[06:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=415)] **Barack Obama**: They trust you. Yeah, and and and they feel as if what you're going through and what [[07:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=425)] they're going through occupies a similar space. Right? And so they don't feel like they're traveling this journey that can [[07:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=432)] be frightening alone sometimes.

[[07:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=432)] **Marc Maron**: That's right. And and yeah, there's a power in the human voice. You know that you [[07:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=438)] you grow attached to. Yeah. So, when you left, what did you do for your mental health with the weight [[07:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=447)] of...

[[07:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=447)] **Barack Obama**: Well, look, how old are you now? I'm 62. Right? So, you know, you you you've still got a [[07:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=456)] couple of chapters left. And my my theory was somebody gave me advice right before I I I was [[07:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=465)] leaving office, uh, and it was, "Don't rush into what the next thing is. Take a beat." Uh-huh. And take [[07:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=477)] some satisfaction looking backwards and saying, "Huh, you know what? Didn't get everything done that I wanted, wasn't always exactly [[08:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=484)] how I planned it, but there's a body of work there that I'm proud of." Right? You know, pat yourself [[08:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=490)] on the back for a second. Just be a little brain dead for a while. Uh, you know, I I've [[08:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=497)] uh, read a bunch of books that had been stacked up. I I had a big uh, deficit with my [[08:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=507)] wife that I had to had to kind of work my way out of. Right? Uh, so we went on [[08:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=512)] a lot of trips and hung out and and and you know, just had nice dinners and and slept in. [[08:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=520)] Um, and then I think, you know, what what this is an opportunity for for you, it was an opportunity [[08:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=528)] for me was figuring out, all right, um, what's my next highest and best use? What's my what what's what's [[08:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=536)] a new purpose that scratches that itch? And it it may not come to you right away. The podcast [[09:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=546)] was kind of a random thing, right? You said, "Well, let's try this out." And and you didn't know it [[09:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=551)] was going to go for 16 years, I I assume when you did the first show.

[[09:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=553)] **Marc Maron**: No, we didn't know [[09:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=555)] anything.

[[09:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=555)] **Barack Obama**: You didn't know anything. You were trying to figure it out. And and and so but but you probably [[09:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=562)] have an inkling of, you know, what you just described about people trusting you, you connecting partly because you're willing [[09:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=571)] to be vulnerable in front of people and and and kind of let them know uh, you know, what's going [[09:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=577)] on inside your gut. Um, there's a power to that. What what's another way of channeling it? Right? That that [[09:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=586)] may be different than you playing a character in a movie or right, you know, you or even you doing [[09:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=591)] standup. There's there's something more raw, honest, exposed about what you do when you're just having a conversation and connecting [[09:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=599)] with people. And so the question is, well, is there another way for me to catch that? You know, but [[01:00:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3605)] you don't have to rush into it. I guess my main thing would be, you know, take your time. Right? [[01:00:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3611)] Unless unless you really got some bills to pay.

[[01:00:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3613)] **Marc Maron**: No, no, I'm okay. But like, it feels like the like, [[01:00:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3616)] I remember when, uh, you left and the, you know, there is this sort of a vacuum, and and in [[01:00:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3625)] terms of like, my, obviously, my responsibility to to my audience is is different, but how do you sort of, [[01:00:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3634)] you know, did did you feel the weight of that responsibility?

[[01:00:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3637)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah, I I mean, what what was unusual for [[01:00:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3645)] me was obviously [[01:00:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3645)] a lot of, uh, what I represented, yeah, a lot of what Michelle and I had tried to project, the [[01:00:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3652)] values, our thinking about America. Um, [[01:01:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3660)] you know, my successor seemed to represent the opposite. Right? Not seemed, did. Yeah. And so I think there is [[01:01:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3670)] a lot of anger, a lot a lot of sadness, yeah, uh, some fear, uh, among a big chunk of the [[01:01:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3679)] country. And I and, you know, one of the problems with, um, the American political system is although we have [[01:01:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3689)] political parties, we don't have a parliamentary system. So, so basically, the president, in my case, uh, Democrat, I leave [[01:01:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3699)] office, and there's no obvious person who's now the shadow prime minister, the leader of the party for the Democrats. [[01:01:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3707)] Right? And so there there were a lot of terrific people who were doing good work, but you know, we [[01:01:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3713)] have this weird situation where you don't have a a designated person who's right, speaking on behalf of the whole [[01:02:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3720)] party. So, um, I actually found myself drawn back in to, uh, uh, day-to-day politics or commentary more than I [[01:02:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3732)] had wanted to be after the second after the, yeah, in 2017, 2018. Um, and I thought I was going [[01:02:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3741)] to be able to remove myself more from being out there in public and was going to be able to [0m 2s] [[01:02:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3749)] concentrate on what I really wanted to do, which was, uh, coach the next generation of leadership.

[[01:02:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3755)] **Marc Maron**: Sure. Um, you [[01:02:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3756)] move from player to coach essentially.

[[01:02:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3757)] **Barack Obama**: And I I kept on being, uh, asked to to comment on news of [[01:02:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3765)] the day and look at this outrage and why aren't you out there more and and and that kind of [[01:02:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3771)] thing. Um, and look, that's flattering and, uh, you know, it's it's an indication that you made a connection with [[01:03:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3780)] people. Sure. Um, but I I I tried to be a little bit disciplined about recognizing that I I'd moved [[01:03:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3794)] on to a new phase where I I did not have formal power. I have some hopefully moral persuasion, some [[01:03:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3801)] some credibility, but I didn't have formal power. And and so more than anything, for the long term, what I [[01:03:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3809)] could do that would be most helpful would be to start promoting up, lifting up, shining a spotlight on those [[01:03:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3820)] you know, that next generation of of leadership and talent, uh, new voices because part of what also happens is, [[01:03:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3828)] you know, um, you know, as you get older, Michelle and I joke about this, um, no matter how much [[01:03:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3838)] you you want to pretend otherwise, you're starting to get a little out of touch. You're not completely, you know, [[01:04:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3847)] plugged into the zeitgeist. And it happens naturally, it just happens.

[[01:04:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3850)] **Marc Maron**: Yeah, I mean, look, I I don't...

[[01:04:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3852)] **Barack Obama**: My brain [[01:04:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3854)] doesn't register TikTok, yeah,

[[01:04:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3856)] **Marc Maron**: Mine neither.

[[01:04:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3856)] **Barack Obama**: The same way that it does my 16-year-old niece. Right?

[[01:04:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3862)] **Marc Maron**: Right. You got [[01:04:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3865)] to get a guy to do it for you.

[[01:04:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3866)] **Barack Obama**: It's not just the the the the technology [[01:04:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3870)] itself. It's that I'm not plugged in. I'm not relating to, yeah, the cultural, you know, stream in the same [[01:04:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3881)] way that somebody who who's 20 or 25 or even 35 is.

[[01:04:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3886)] **Marc Maron**: But that's an interesting point is that you [[01:04:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3889)] know, human connection, you know, TikTok and like, when you and I did the podcast, 2015, the landscape was [[01:04:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3896)] was not as glutted. You know, Instagram didn't have the power it does. TikTok, I don't even know if [[01:05:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3901)] it was around.

[[01:05:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3901)] **Barack Obama**: No, not that I remember.

[[01:05:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3903)] **Marc Maron**: And, you know, there was a a way of of making a [[01:05:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3906)] real connection, and it seems like a lot of these platforms now, like TikTok is just an inundation of [[01:05:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3912)] stuff that like, what a like, I know when I talk to you and I can feel it and and [[01:05:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3918)] you can hear it that there's a human connection, right? And it seems like, you know, that's necessary.

[[01:05:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3925)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. It [[01:05:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3926)] I listen, I've been wrestling with this for a while. You know, um, people talk about me being the first [[01:05:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3932)] digital president, and and that's true. Obviously, the internet existed before me, and but but you know, I when I [[01:05:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3941)] came into office in 2009, you know, the smartphone was not yet widely around. Um, and so the smartphone comes [[01:05:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3952)] out around 2010. Facebook, Twitter, a lot of social media is just taking off. Um, it seemed optimistic.

[[01:06:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3961)] **Marc Maron**: It did. [[01:06:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3962)] Right?

[[01:06:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3962)] **Barack Obama**: So, so, you know, there's there's all this sense of this is human connection. My campaign wouldn't work. I [[01:06:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3968)] I joke about the fact that, um, I was an early adopter of all this social media, not because, by [[01:06:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3975)] the way, I was so, uh, smart. It was that my campaign was broke enough that I had to rely [[01:06:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3983)] on a bunch of 20 and 25 year olds volunteering in our office. Yeah. And they'd say like, "Hey, uh, [[01:06:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3990)] Senator, um, this is a website." I said, "Ah, website. Great." You know, so...

[[01:06:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3995)] **Marc Maron**: Sounds good. Sounds good.

[[01:06:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3996)] **Barack Obama**: And say, [[01:06:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=3997)] "So, you can have pictures and you can have even video on there. And see this little box like people [[01:06:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4002)] can can click it and and they can contribute money, right?" And I'd be like, "Really? That's good. That, well, [[01:06:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4007)] that's that seems useful." And and then they say, "And this one, they can like, volunteer." And I'd I'd be [[01:06:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4011)] like, "Well, that's great. Yeah, let's do that." And and so I probably, I mean, part of the reason I [[01:06:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4018)] was elected was we were adapting all these new media. But, you know, this dates myself. When I talk to [[01:07:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4026)] audiences, I was like, my social media, our social media was MySpace and Meetup. Right?

[[01:07:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4033)] **Marc Maron**: Now, Meetup is the one [[01:07:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4035)] that I always tell people is the most interesting to me. I don't even know what it is. I missed [[01:07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4040)]...

[[01:07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4040)] **Barack Obama**: So, Meetup was, you know, it was it was a social media early, yeah, early early, uh, application, and you [[01:07:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4049)] could send basically text over. So, so let's say there were a bunch of volunteers up in Idaho.

[[01:07:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4053)] **Marc Maron**: Oh, yeah. [[01:07:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4055)] Yeah.

[[01:07:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4055)] **Barack Obama**: And you know, Idaho is not a big blue state with a lot of delegates, so we don't have [[01:07:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4062)] the resources to send a whole staff right, paid staff up to Idaho. But we have, you know, a few [[01:07:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4068)] volunteers, uh, some people, some supporters, they send us a message saying, "Hey, we're Idahoans for Obama." Yeah. And, uh, [[01:07:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4077)] we'd we we'd love to to build a we think, you know, you can win this, uh, state. And so, [[01:08:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4083)] we go, "All right." So, we'd send a bunch of information through Meetup, and we'd give them the app, and [[01:08:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4089)] basically, what the app would do is you could send out, "Here's Obama's positions on things. Here's, you know, dates [[01:08:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4098)] of debates and this and that." But the main thing it did, hence the name, was it would help these [[01:08:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4106)] volunteers organize themselves to meet up in person.

[[01:08:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4109)] **Marc Maron**: In person.

[[01:08:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4110)] **Barack Obama**: In a church basement, in a bar, right, in a [[01:08:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4114)] VFW hall, whatever. And what I always tell people was wonderful about this rudimentary app was [[01:08:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4126)] they'd show up, and they actually met in person, and maybe they were assuming that they were all thought the [[01:08:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4133)] same way and right, were were had the same positions on everything. And they'd show up at some, you [[01:08:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4139)] know, Obama volunteer meeting, and you'd have a, you know, what looked like a ex-army sergeant with a crew [[01:09:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4146)] cut, and you'd have a a black young black woman with a nose ring, and you'd have a suburban mom, [[01:09:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4154)] you know, with some kids. And it turned out that by virtue of meeting in person, you kind of realized, [[01:09:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4161)] "People are a little more complicated."

[[01:09:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4162)] **Marc Maron**: Sure.

[[01:09:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4163)] **Barack Obama**: Maybe they don't agree with me on everything. Right? Maybe they're, and that's [[01:09:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4168)] a good thing. Right? So, so it creates this friction and this interest and and it it it forced people [[01:09:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4175)] to kind of say, "All right, well, you know, it turns out that I don't have to agree with everything [[01:09:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4179)] to to work with somebody." Right? And then out of out of those meetings, they'd have to go out and [[01:09:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4185)] start knocking on doors. And that's the ultimate meetup because now you're you're you're forcing yourself to talk to strangers [[01:09:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4191)] who definitely don't agree with you on stuff. But there was that sense of human interaction in all. And and [[01:10:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4201)] that that that gave people a sense of how somebody could be a good guy but also have blind spots, [[01:10:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4207)] somebody could be, you know, uh, seem like a real jerk and yet there's this redeeming quality. They they they [[01:10:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4219)] sense that you get living in a neighborhood, right?

[[01:10:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4222)] **Marc Maron**: Oh, yeah.

[[01:10:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4223)] **Barack Obama**: Which which is like, you go to the soccer [[01:10:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4224)] game, and all the parents are sitting around, and you know, some guy or or gal may may not be [[01:10:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4231)] your cup of tea, but then you see him hug their kid, and you go, "Oh," and you know what, [[01:10:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4236)] he's all right. He's all right.

[[01:10:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4237)] **Marc Maron**: Well, and that's foundational to democracy working.

[[01:10:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4240)] **Barack Obama**: Correct.

[[01:10:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4240)] **Marc Maron**: And and what happens now is [[01:10:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4243)] that, uh, with, you know, us and them and with, uh, all these social media platforms, you know, being, uh, [[01:10:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4251)] individual's reality, right? So, there's no conversation. You just got people blasting away at your face all day. And and [[01:10:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4258)] and the and the whole reeling thing, the algorithm.

[[01:11:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4260)] **Barack Obama**: Yes. Yes. Yes.

[[01:11:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4261)] **Marc Maron**: It does capture your mind and send you [[01:11:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4268)] down a very narrow track in a way that... and it's interesting for me, I I said like, my brain [[01:11:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4274)] doesn't work that way. Right? But I'll be honest with you, with me, it's mostly like sports videos.

[[01:11:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4280)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. Sure. [[01:11:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4281)] But I I see how this mechanism works where you can just get on a track, and that algorithm is [[01:11:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4290)] powerful, and you will suddenly be consumed by this thing for half an hour or and you look up and [[01:11:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4299)] you've wasted a whole bunch of time. And and but what it's also done is it has narrowed your world [[01:11:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4305)] significantly. And and if if you get on on a political or social track on those reels, um, it's hard [[01:11:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4315)] to break.

[[01:11:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4315)] **Marc Maron**: It'll break your brain.

[[01:11:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4317)] **Barack Obama**: It'll break your brain.

[[01:11:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4317)] **Marc Maron**: And it's and it's it's it's so, uh, terrifying and [[01:12:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4321)] disturbing that where you don't and also the dopamine part of it. It's that people don't have necessarily whether they [[01:12:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4328)] do or not, it it'll annihilate the their sense of values, it'll annihilate principles, you know, in a way because [[01:12:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4335)] it works them up by delivering this thing.

[[01:12:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4337)] **Barack Obama**: Well, it it is well known. I mean, this has been documented [[01:12:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4342)] that, uh, you know, the the design of phones, the way social media apps are set up, a lot of [[01:12:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4350)] that is science based on, uh, that that arose out of, you know, figuring out how to make addiction. Right? [[01:12:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4358)] Figuring out how to make slot machines.

[[01:12:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4359)] **Marc Maron**: Sure. Sure.

[[01:12:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4359)] **Barack Obama**: I mean, there's a reason why all these pings and lights [[01:12:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4364)] and, you know, stuff comes up on your phone when notifications come, if you haven't silenced it on your phone. [[01:12:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4371)] Right? Just that sense of that... the only game I really play is, uh, on my my phone is Word [[01:12:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4378)] with Friends with Pete Souza, my my old photographer from the White House. Sure. Took our picture. Yeah. And, um, [[01:13:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4385)] and it's just a way for us to stay in touch. Yeah. There's a very particular ping that comes up [[01:13:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4392)] when he's played. And if my if I haven't turned my phone off, it I I could be in the [[01:13:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4400)] middle of negotiations on a, you know, nuclear treaty, and that thing goes off. There's a part of me that's [[01:13:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4408)] like, you know what? I got to I wonder what he played. Right? So, so all that is shaping, um, [[01:13:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4417)] the political environment in ways that even when you and I talked in in in what, 2015, it it that [[01:13:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4424)] didn't exist. And now the interesting thing is podcasting. Uh-huh. Um, is obviously, it's gotten segmented and and and it's [[01:13:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4437)] getting chopped up so that people don't listen to a whole conversation on the video. Yeah, on the video and [[01:14:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4442)] all that stuff. There is still, I think, a power in just people listening to conversations, if they listen to [[01:14:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4452)] the whole thing.

[[01:14:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4452)] **Marc Maron**: Sure.

[[01:14:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4452)] **Barack Obama**: That I I think is different.

[[01:14:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4454)] **Marc Maron**: Yeah, I I you know, you you and Rogan, I [[01:14:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4461)] guess came up, yeah, started right around the same time. Right?

[[01:14:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4464)] **Barack Obama**: And it it was interesting to me when you [[01:14:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4470)] know, people started criticizing, I don't know, Bernie or somebody else for going on Rogan. Right? It's like, "Well, why [[01:14:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4478)] wouldn't you?" Yeah, of course. Go go go go go if if you have time to go have a conversation [[01:14:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4483)] with somebody that you know, then that is consistent with democracy to to to me engaging in an honest conversation [[01:14:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4497)] that's not just yelling, not just trying to score points, but, all right, I'm going to take time to listen [[01:15:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4503)] and then I'm going to kind of share how I'm I'm thinking about things. Um, still valuable. That that part [[01:15:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4509)] of it is valuable. And and the fact that we can have access to that, um, that that we can [[01:15:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4516)] we can in some ways participate in that conversation, I I I think is is actually not the big the [[01:15:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4525)] the big problem. The problem that happens with podcasts is that they get all chopped up and then then it [[01:15:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4532)] it it gets put up on the on the the video stream, and, um,

[[01:15:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4536)] **Marc Maron**: The content economy.

[[01:15:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4537)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. The one [[01:15:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4539)] thing that we did was always keep it audio, so then we were kind of...

[[01:15:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4543)] **Marc Maron**: It's harder to to clip [[01:15:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4545)] audio.

[[01:15:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4545)] **Barack Obama**: Correct.

[[01:15:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4545)] **Marc Maron**: And and full. And the people that listen to my show, yeah, are in for the whole conversation. [[01:15:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4551)] And I and I think what you're talking about, which, you know, I try to kind of under understand or [[01:15:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4557)] or wrap my brain around is that there's a tribalization happening, uh, in terms of, even if Bernie, you know, [[01:16:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4563)] goes on Joe, you know that, you know, Bernie is focused and he knows what he wants to say. But [[01:16:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4569)] you you know, in when it's taken out of context or it's or it's, you know, solely looked at by [[01:16:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4575)] a bubble of people that the the message can become obscured, right? And diminished.

[[01:16:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4582)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. But but look, there's this [[01:16:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4583)] young state rep, uh, James Talarico, who was on there a while back out of Texas.

[[01:16:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4587)] **Marc Maron**: Oh, that guy's good. [[01:16:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4588)] Right?

[[01:16:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4588)] **Barack Obama**: He's terrific, really talented young man. And and you know, [[01:16:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4596)] it it does require a certain confidence in your actual convictions to debate and have a conversation with somebody who [[01:16:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4606)] disagrees with you on a whole bunch of stuff.

[[01:16:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4608)] **Marc Maron**: What makes him so good, though? Because there is something grounded [[01:16:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4611)] about him that you had it, too. I I I...

[[01:16:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4614)] **Barack Obama**: You know what, so so in our foundation, a lot [[01:16:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4618)] of the work that that I do is is is working with young civic leaders, political leaders, journalists, human rights [[01:17:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4626)] lawyers, not just here in the United States, but around the world. And one of the first things I say [[01:17:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4632)] to him is, uh, "Know what you really believe." Right? Like, that's your starting point. Right? And if you know [[01:17:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4644)] what you... first of all, if if if you understand your convictions, you got a moral compass, you got a [[01:17:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4650)] code, you you've spent time wrestling with what it is that you care about and what you believe, yeah, then [[01:17:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4657)] it's a lot easier now to be open and actually listen to other people, uh, and as opposed to constantly [[01:17:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4665)] trying to beat off anybody who might contradict, right, uh, you know, your your your current, uh, perspective. And I [[01:17:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4674)] think a guy like him, uh, he's his starting point is, "Let me let me say what I believe." And [[01:18:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4683)] and it doesn't mean that anybody in public life and and by the way, anybody who's married, anybody who's in [[01:18:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4689)] a relationship, you know, it doesn't mean that you you you can't practice the art of diplomacy, that you can't [[01:18:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4698)] compromise in ways that are are more likely to be received, right? Um, you know, but it it it [[01:18:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4708)] I think now more than ever, what people long for—and and the word authenticity gets overused—I think what [[01:18:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4718)] people long for is, uh, some core integrity that that seems absent. Just a sense that, ah, you know, the [[01:18:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4730)] the person seems to, um, walk the walk, doesn't just talk the talk.

[[01:18:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4734)] **Marc Maron**: Well, there's a vulnerability to that.

[[01:18:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4735)] **Barack Obama**: Yes. [[01:18:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4736)] And there's a vulnerability to, you know, having that integrity and having those principles where if you're going to do [[01:19:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4743)] it, you know, straight, that, you know, you have to leave yourself open, uh, to what's going to come back [[01:19:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4753)] at you.

[[01:19:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4753)] **Marc Maron**: And still stand strong.

[[01:19:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4754)] **Barack Obama**: Correct. And and and and sometimes it's going to be uncomfortable and and painful. [[01:19:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4759)] Yeah. Look, and and and I and I think that that's, um, you know, there's been a lot of post-mortem [[01:19:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4767)] about Democrats and, yeah, progressives and, you know, I saw, you know, your your standup where you said, you know, [[01:19:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4777)] you know, somehow, you know, we we we figured out how to be so annoying and we annoyed the average [[01:19:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4782)] American into fascism, yeah, which which cracked cracked me up because there I I wasn't as funny about saying this [[01:19:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4793)] but even, you know, four, five, six years ago, I'd say, you know, you you can't just be a scold [[01:20:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4800)] all the time. You you you you can't, um, constantly lecture people without acknowledging that you've got some blind spots [[01:20:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4812)] too and that life's messy and, uh, you know, and and and and so the the vulnerability, I think, comes in [[01:20:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4820)] in saying, right, "I've got some core convictions. I've got beliefs that I'm not going to compromise, but I'm also [[01:20:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4830)] not going to assert that I am so righteous and so pure and and and and so insightful that there's [[01:20:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4841)] not the possibility that maybe I'm wrong on this."

[[01:20:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4843)] **Marc Maron**: Sure.

[[01:20:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4843)] **Barack Obama**: Or that, you know, other people, if they don't say [[01:20:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4849)] things exactly the way I say them or see things exactly the way I do, that somehow they're bad people. [[01:20:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4854)] And and and and so there was this weird what what I saw, uh, in and and and I think [[01:21:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4864)] this was a fault of of some progressive language was, um, almost asserting a a a holier-than-thou superiority [[01:21:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4876)] that's not that different from what we used to joke about coming from, you know, the the right and the [[01:21:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4884)] moral majority and, you know, far away and a certain fundamentalism about how to think about stuff that I think [[01:21:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4890)] was dangerous.

[[01:21:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4891)] **Marc Maron**: But because it was also a single issue, yeah.

[[01:21:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4894)] **Barack Obama**: That they...

[[01:21:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4894)] **Marc Maron**: If you have progressives, like, you know, [[01:21:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4898)] and how you straddled this stuff in in general with being you, you know, constantly trolled and attacked by the [[01:21:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4904)] right and then you have the left who are like, "Well, he droned a lot of people," and then it [[01:21:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4908)] never goes... I I'd get my ass kicked.

[[01:21:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4910)] **Barack Obama**: Right. Just...

[[01:21:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4910)] **Marc Maron**: But but it seemed like the intention on on your [[01:21:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4915)] behalf—and I noticed this is something that happened to me recently. I was in Canada, you know, for a [0m 2s] [[01:21:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4919)] couple days, and, uh, and I was talking to somebody up there and and and and I said the the [[01:22:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4925)] best thing that that that Trump has done is bring your country together. [[01:22:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4932)] They they they do seem to be, uh, rallying around the the maple leaf. But it but it was it [[01:22:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4938)] was fundamentally like, you know, despite whatever differences they have—and it is a parliamentary system up there—but [[01:22:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4944)] as individuals that however they were leaning culturally, right or left, that when, you know, the bullying started and the [[01:22:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4952)] tariffs started and the threats started, they were able to to go down to their core beliefs of what their [[01:22:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4958)] country meant, yes, and and what it what it meant to them.

[[01:22:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4962)] **Barack Obama**: Correct.

[[01:22:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4962)] **Marc Maron**: And and how they were, you know, [[01:22:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4963)] going to come together and and, you know, rebuild from the inside so we don't have to deal with this. [[01:22:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4970)] But it struck me as to like, you know, well, how how are—and I know the answer to some [[01:22:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4977)] level—how are we not capable of it? How is it that most people don't understand the civic responsibility or [[01:23:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4982)] the civic structure of how this country is supposed to work outside of the people that are shamelessly, uh, against [[01:23:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4990)] it?

[[01:23:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4990)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. Look, I I mean, [[01:23:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=4995)] I think the the the way I describe it, America has always had [[01:23:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5003)] warring narratives. I mean, a lot of American history is is a war of ideas, right? And and, you know, [[01:23:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5013)] I I gave a speech—probably my the the speech that is closest to my heart that I gave throughout [[01:23:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5021)] my presidency was the speech I gave on the 50th anniversary of Selma, the the the march on Selma over [[01:23:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5027)] the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And, you know, I I talked about that clash being as important as as Gettysburg or [[01:24:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5041)] Appomattox. You've got on one side John Lewis and a ragtag band of, you know, Pullman porters and maids [[01:24:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5051)] and clergy and a couple rabbis and college kids, and they're marching from one side. And on the other side, you've [[01:24:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5061)] got, um, you know, folks with billy clubs on horseback and fire hoses and dogs and all that. And what [[01:24:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5073)] what John Lewis represented was the narrative that says "We the people" means just what it says, that we hold [[01:24:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5083)] these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. Uh, and on the other side was the fact [[01:24:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5092)] of slavery and conquest and hierarchy and domination. And if you didn't have property, you didn't vote, and women weren't [[01:25:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5102)] involved, and and and that was always part of America, too. Right? And and and the question has always been, [[01:25:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5115)] "Can we pull off this experiment in which people are showing up from all over the place? They're not tied [[01:25:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5124)] together by blood. They don't necessarily worship God in the same way or worship God at all. They they they [[01:25:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5132)] they speak different languages. They they they have all these weird foods. They they they show up with these odd customs, [[01:25:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5139)] and and and some of them were dragged here in chains, and and and some of them had had their [[01:25:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5147)] their land taken from them and their culture destroyed." And and out of all that, can we create a a [[01:25:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5157)] a a shared creed, right, that allows us to live peacefully together and get stuff done? And on the other [[01:26:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5167)] side, there has always been the idea that no, no, "We the people" means something very particular, yeah, at each [[01:26:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5174)] stage. And and look, this led to ultimately civil war. But even after civil war, you got Jim Crow and [[01:26:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5181)] reconstruction and the Klan and you there's always been this fight over what is the the true story of America. [[01:26:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5191)] And and I believe deeply in this story that, yeah, if we can pull this off, if if we can [[01:26:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5200)] actually treat everybody with decency and respect and compromise and make democracy work, it shines a light for the entire [[01:26:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5206)] world. Right? And the other path of of tribe and a zero-sum game and everything's dog-eat-dog and [[01:26:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5216)] a competition and you try to take advantage of the other person because they're going to try to take advantage [[01:27:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5220)] of you, and if they don't look like you and they don't believe what you do and they have a [[01:27:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5224)] different faith than you, that that they're a threat to you. That is the path that leads to things like [[01:27:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5230)] World War II and the Holocaust and, uh, you know, slavery and and and Pol Pot and and and Rwanda, [[01:27:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5242)] and, you know, we've we see how that plays out. And and so the question is, you know, can we [[01:27:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5250)] can can can the better, in my mind, can the can that better story win? And I and I think [[01:27:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5255)] that after World War II, you and I are basically the same generation. We grew up in a co a [[01:27:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5265)] monoculture [[01:27:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5265)] with and and as flawed as it was, you know, with TV and Walter Cronkite, we were all watching the [[01:27:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5272)] same things. We were seeing the same things. We were listening to the same things. There were groups that weren't [[01:27:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5276)] represented. There was, you know, bias in it. Women didn't have power, you know, and were stereotyped in all kinds [[01:28:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5286)] of awful ways. Uh, the LGBT community was just invisible and forced in the closet. There was all kinds of [[01:28:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5295)] flaws to it. But it but there was a common narrative that said, "Yeah, you know, we can all pledge [[01:28:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5303)] allegiance to the flag. We can all, uh, you know, feel that we are full-fledged, you know, true, you know, [[01:28:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5319)] blooded Americans, uh, because we believe in these these certain these ideals." And what you're seeing right now is a [[01:28:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5328)] reassertion of this idea of like, nope, "If you don't look a certain way, you don't think a certain way, [[01:28:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5336)] you don't practice a certain faith, um, you know, you're not a real American." And and I started to see [[01:29:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5342)] this during my that that's what birtherism was about. Right? Yeah. That's that's what when Sarah Palin was talking about [[01:29:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5349)] real Americans versus right, I guess the unreal Americans. It was that that was already boiling over. And I say [[01:29:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5357)] all that because I think that, um, I think the majority, the vast majority of Americans, I still, I think, [[01:29:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5368)] still believe in in that creed, that sense of of unity, that that that sense of a shared narrative. But [[01:29:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5376)] it's not reinforced a lot in the media. And that's where we get back to this whole issue of social [[01:29:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5381)] media. You you don't hear that that um, that sense of of what we have in common except during the [[01:29:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5392)] Super Bowl and a couple of other. Yeah, maybe during the Olympics.

[[01:29:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5395)] **Marc Maron**: A sense of unity, a sense of like people [[01:29:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5399)] helping each other.

[[01:30:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5400)] **Barack Obama**: Like, I believe that what you're talking about, you know, politically in in terms of of what [[01:30:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5406)] we spoke about earlier, that people are different and some may have different beliefs, but there was a compromise that [[01:30:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5411)] could be met and that tolerance in and of itself was is is conditional to democracy working.

[[01:30:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5418)] **Barack Obama**: Forbearance, I think [[01:30:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5419)] is the the formal term that political science use. You have to put up with folks.

[[01:30:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5423)] **Marc Maron**: That's right.

[[01:30:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5423)] **Barack Obama**: If they [[01:30:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5424)] as long as they're not actively hurting you, right, you've got to put up with them. And and you can [[01:30:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5429)] battle them and and ultimately, it gets sorted out in politics, and the the winners get to move their agenda [[01:30:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5437)] forward, and the losers lick their wounds and come back later. But there's always that sense of, yeah, but but [[01:30:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5444)] we're not going to call each other vermin, right? And we're not going to try to crush you if you [[01:30:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5449)] lose.

[[01:30:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5449)] **Marc Maron**: That's right. But the we're not going to target you.

[[01:30:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5452)] **Marc Maron**: But the brains have been, you know, broken, you [[01:30:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5455)] know, through exploiting grievance and anger. And, you know, in talking about the left that the fact that so many [[01:31:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5463)] uh, decided to not vote out of protest because they didn't feel that the, you know, the situation in Israel, [[01:31:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5471)] the ethnic cleansing of of Gaza and whatnot was not going to be dealt with by Kamala or however that [[01:31:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5477)] goes. So, you get this protest vote of people not willing to make a compromise for what you used to [[01:31:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5482)] talk about as the incremental progress.

[[01:31:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5485)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. Well, and and and look, that that's the thing that I spent a [[01:31:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5489)] lot of time talking to younger leaders about this. And it's there's no simple solution to it. But I will [[01:31:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5495)] say that part of what a liberal democracy requires is an acceptance of partial victory. Right? And not not perfection. [[01:31:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5514)] You know, when I was in the White House, I'd sit around on any issue with my cabinet or my [[01:32:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5521)] staff, senior staff, and we'd go around analyzing everything. And at some point, I'd say, "All right, I think I've [[01:32:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5527)] got all the information. If we do X, is this going to make things better?" [[01:32:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5536)] Because and I'd say, I'd tell them, "Better is good. We're not going to get to perfect." Right? If if [[01:32:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5543)] you're telling me that the Affordable Care Act is going to ensure 50 million people, do I think that's better [[01:32:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5549)] than if we had a if we were starting from scratch and I can get a single-payer plan instituted and [[01:32:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5556)] and and get that through Congress and suddenly we had universal healthcare and we had taken the profit motive out [[01:32:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5561)] of...? Do I think that would probably be a smarter way to...? Absolutely. Right? But since I can't do that [[01:32:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5568)] yet, I don't have the votes for that, how about this? Yeah, we can make it better. We can make [[01:32:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5573)] it better. Right? And and you know, this, um, this sense that things aren't worth it unless we get everything [[01:33:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5590)] we want, I think, uh, is is either a recipe for disappointment in in a democracy, but also maybe in [[01:33:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5601)] life. Um, or it leads to this weird cynicism where you just withdraw entirely.

[[01:33:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5607)] **Marc Maron**: That's that's and that's part of [[01:33:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5611)] what happened to, uh, too many of our folks. Um, we we I I think we we we decided, all [[01:33:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5620)] right, "If I'm not going to get everything, then that justifies doing nothing."

[[01:33:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5624)] **Barack Obama**: It's interesting. I had a conversation [[01:33:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5629)] with Malia, my daughter, yeah, this was probably three, four years ago. And she was saying to me, "Dad, you [[01:33:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5639)] know, I'm talking to a bunch of my friends, and and this climate change thing, you know, they're just everybody [[01:34:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5644)] just feels like it's hopeless now. It looks like, you know, we just keep on throwing this crud into the [[01:34:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5652)] air. People aren't listening to science, and we're going to blow through these targets that the scientists tell us, you [[01:34:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5660)] know, if we don't keep it at a 2% Celsius increase, um, you know, we're going to have these catastrophes, [[01:34:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5668)] and it doesn't seem like there's any chance for us to do it. So, a bunch of my friends now [[01:34:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5673)] say, you know, what's the point? Right? Like, you know, it's too late. So, what should I tell them?" [[01:34:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5681)] And I said, "Well, you know what? It's true that we probably will blow through this target, um, because it's [[01:34:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5689)] really hard for humans. It's never been done before to completely re-engineer our energy sources in one generation. And there's [[01:34:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5699)] greed and profit motives and just getting people organized and legacy systems. It's it's hard. But actually, we're making some [[01:35:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5707)] progress. I said, you know, if if we're able to stop the increase at 2.5 instead of three, it'll there [[01:35:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5719)] will still be a lot of disruptions and and flooding and drought and wildfires, and some bad stuff will happen. [[01:35:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5727)] But, you know what? That half a centigrade difference, that could be the diff that could make a difference in [[01:35:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5736)] in a billion people's lives."

[[01:35:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5737)] **Marc Maron**: Right. Totally.

[[01:35:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5738)] **Barack Obama**: And I and I and so I I told her, I said, "You [[01:35:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5742)] tell your friends, 'Well, that's worth working for.'" Yeah. You know, it it doesn't mean that we won't have some [[01:35:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5751)] really serious problems because of climate change.

[[01:35:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5753)] **Marc Maron**: But that's the reality.

[[01:35:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5754)] **Barack Obama**: But that's the reality. But, you know what? That [[01:35:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5756)] half percent difference, that that that could be in entire coastal villages. It could be, you know, what happens in Bangladesh [[01:36:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5767)] where hundreds of thousands or millions of people can eat instead of not eat. It could affect whether or not [[01:36:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5775)] people can make a living where they live as opposed to trying to cross the oceans to migrate to places [[01:36:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5780)] where they can. And and and all the political conflicts that come with that. That that mentality of understanding we [[01:36:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5788)] should be doing better than we're doing. We it's it's a shame that we're stuck with, um, this crazy, you [[01:36:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5798)] know, shortsighted approach to climate. But, well, let's let's see what we can get done. That, I think, is the [[01:36:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5807)] mentality that all of us have to carry with us.

[[01:36:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5808)] **Marc Maron**: Well, I I think what you were talking about about [[01:36:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5813)] about cynicism and disengagement is now there's a level of fear that is is real, right? And and and justified. [[01:37:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5822)] Totally. So, you know, what happens, you know, in terms of what we're talking about, all the things that were [[01:37:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5829)] that you live through and and and we live through, whether we were kids or not, the progress that was [[01:37:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5835)] made, uh, civil rights, gay rights, women's rights, uh, you know, things, uh, policies that were meant to, you know, [[01:37:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5843)] make an attempt at at sort of expanding democratic ideas. And you always had this core group of the other [[01:37:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5852)] side that have been, you trying to dismantle this from, you know, since the New Deal. But now, you know, [[01:37:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5858)] and look, the the left and and people like me, you know, you you throw around the words, you know, [[01:37:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5866)] fascism in relation to authority just willy-nilly, right? And you you talk about authoritarianism as if it's something that happens [[01:37:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5875)] everywhere else. And I think right now you have a lot of people who are still locked into this like, [[01:37:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5879)] it could never happen here. But at some point, don't we have to wake up and say, "It's happening?"

[[01:38:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5885)] **Barack Obama**: I [[01:38:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5886)] think there is no doubt that [[01:38:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5892)] a lot of the norms, civic habits, expectations, uh, institutional guardrails that we had that we took for granted [[01:38:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5908)] for our democracy have been weakened deliberately. I don't think they're destroyed, but I think they have been damaged, and [[01:38:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5921)] it's and and they've been systematic about it. I you know, when I when I used to travel around the [[01:38:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5928)] world, um, you know, this is back when, uh, democracy promotion was still bipartisan. Right? You know, George Bush was [[01:38:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5938)] for it, Bill Clinton was for it, yeah, I was for it. Uh, Marco Rubio apparently was for it. Right? [[01:39:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5946)] So, so it it wasn't controversial for me to go to other countries and say, "You know what? It it's [[01:39:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5956)] a good idea for militaries to be under civilian control." You know, yeah, because, um, when when you have militaries [[01:39:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5970)] that can direct force against their own people, that is that is inherently corrupting. [[01:39:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5980)] And so when you now start seeing the politization of the military deliberately, right? They just landed in Chicago.

[[01:39:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5988)] **Marc Maron**: Yeah. [[01:39:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5990)] That...

[[01:39:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=5990)] **Barack Obama**: That, uh, when you have what what looks like a deliberate end run around not just a concept [[01:40:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6003)] but a law that's been around for a long time, Posse Comitatus, that says, you know, you don't use our military [[01:40:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6014)] on domestic soil, un unless there is a extraordinary emergency of some sort, short. That when when when you see [[01:40:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6026)] an administration suggest that ordinary street crime is an insurrection or or a terrorist act,

[[01:40:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6034)] **Marc Maron**: Or a terrorist act. [[01:40:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6038)] You know, that is a genuine effort to weaken how we have understood democracy. Then that that was understood by Democrats [[01:40:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6055)] and Republicans. [[01:40:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6059)] I always try to... I mean, it's it's almost too easy of a thought experiment. If I had sent in [[01:41:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6067)] the National Guard into Texas and just said, "You know what? A lot of problems in Dallas. [[01:41:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6078)] You know, a lot of crime there, and uh, I don't care what Governor Abbott says. I'm I'm going to kind of take [[01:41:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6086)] over law enforcement because I think things are out of control." It It is mind-boggling to me how,

[[01:41:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6092)] **Marc Maron**: Oh, yeah. [[01:41:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6093)] Fox News would have responded.

[[01:41:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6095)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. I I I mean, there were times where I remember there there was there [[01:41:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6100)] was a moment—I don't remember what year this was—where the military just had regular exercises in Texas out [[01:41:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6108)] of one of the bases, Fort Wood or and uh, and I Ted Cruz and and a number of other [[01:41:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6118)] folks were out there lending credence to the fact that I was preparing for, you know, the the whole black [[01:42:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6126)] helicopter one world government, I was about to take over Texas. And this is like a sitting U.S. Senator was [[01:42:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6132)] like kind of retweeting about what what what's going on with these exercises, secret ops. I didn't even have any [[01:42:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6140)] I I didn't monitor military exercises because, you know what? That was the Pentagon's job. That was the Secretary of [[01:42:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6147)] Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the COCOMs. That was their job to to prepare and focus on [[01:42:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6157)] military readiness, and then they'd report to me. The the point is that we have blown through just in the [[01:42:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6165)] last six months a whole range of of not not simply assumptions but rules and laws and and practices that [[01:42:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6178)] were put in place to ensure that, uh, you know, nobody's above the law and that we don't use the [[01:43:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6192)] federal government to simply reward our friends and and and punish our enemies. And the same thing's obviously happening in [[01:43:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6200)] the Justice Department. So, people are right to be concerned. The the interesting thing and and and what I've been [[01:43:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6210)] trying to do when I've been speaking about this publicly is just to remind folks, you know, just as was [[01:43:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6218)] true during the McCarthy era and and has been true throughout our history, what's required in these situations is a [[01:43:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6227)] few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks, and then more people stand up and kind of go [[01:43:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6234)] like, "Yeah, no, that's that's not who we are. That's not that's not that's not our idea of America. We [[01:44:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6242)] we don't want masked, you know, folks with rifles and and and machine guns on patrolling our streets. You [[01:44:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6256)] know, we we we we want we want cops on the beat who know the neighborhood, local neighborhood and and [[01:44:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6264)] the kids around and and and that's how we keep the peace around here. You know, we we don't want [[01:44:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6269)] uh, you know, kangaroo courts and trumped-up charges. That's what happens in in other places that we used to [[01:44:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6276)] scold for doing that. You know, we we want like like our court system and our Justice Department and our [[01:44:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6284)] prosecutors to be and our FBI to be just playing things straight and looking at the facts and not meddling [[01:44:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6291)] in in in politics the way, uh, the way we've seen later lately." And I think if enough people start [[01:45:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6300)] not not being in a fetal position, but also not being just not worrying about it and and detached from [[01:45:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6310)] it, but but being vigilant but also saying, "Huh, you know what? We, yeah, we can stand up to this. [[01:45:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6317)] You know, we can call it like we see it." Yeah. You know, you know, we need we need people [[01:45:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6326)] who have whatever platforms they have to be able to say, "No, that's not who we are." And to be [[01:45:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6335)] willing to get attacked on X by whoever for doing that. And And it's not easy. Yeah, because sometimes you [[01:45:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6346)] fear for your life. Yeah. And and and, you know, there's this whole process of doxing. And, you know, I [[01:45:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6354)] always used to Michelle and I talk about, um, the fact that, you know, a lot of our friends, we [[01:46:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6364)] used to call them civilians, 'cause if they got criticized, you know, on the comment page about something, yeah, they'd [[01:46:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6370)] be freaked out. And we're like, "You know what?" I mean, we we've had so much, you know, incoming over [[01:46:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6378)] the course of 10 years. Now, we chose it or at least I chose it, Mitch, as Michelle will point [[01:46:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6382)] out, and then she was subjected to it. Um, that that, yeah, we you do get a tougher skin. But [[01:46:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6388)] I understand how it's hard when suddenly your email, you know, your email or or your you phone is filled [[01:46:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6396)] up with hostile, nasty, trolling garbage.

[[01:46:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6398)] **Marc Maron**: Trolling garbage.

[[01:46:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6399)] **Barack Obama**: Right. And and you've gotten used to it, too. But I But [[01:46:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6404)] I tell you, you know, it's not like we're not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson [[01:46:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6412)] Mandela and be in a 10 by 12 jail cell for 27 years and and break rocks. We're not at [[01:47:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6420)] that point right now. There's just a little discomfort. And so when I say, for example, if you're a law [[01:47:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6427)] firm, you know, you saying to, "We're going to represent who we want and we're going to stand up for [[01:47:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6438)] uh, what we think is our core mission of upholding the law and maybe we'll lose some business for that, [[01:47:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6445)] but that's what we believe." That's what's needed. If you're a university president, say, "Well, you know what? This [[01:47:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6453)] will hurt if we lose some grant money from the federal government, but that's that's what endowments are for. Let's [[01:47:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6460)] let's see if we can ride this out because what we're not going to do is compromise our basic, uh, [[01:47:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6464)] academic independence." If you're a business and you say, "You know what? You know, we're we're we're not we're going to [[01:47:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6474)] we we think it's important because of what this country is to hire people from different backgrounds and and and [[01:48:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6482)] we're not going to be bullied into saying that we can only, you know, hire people or promote people based [[01:48:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6488)] on some criteria that's been cooked up by Stephen Miller." Yeah. You know, we all have this capacity, I think, [[01:48:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6498)] to to take a stand. And and and ultimately, this goes back to something I said earlier about convictions. You [[01:48:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6507)] know, if if con if convictions don't cost anything, then they're really just kind of fashion. They're not really conviction. [[01:48:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6517)] And and I do think that our generation, yours and mine, Mark, 'cause again, we're about the same age, we [[01:48:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6523)] were so accustomed to things kind of getting better consistently over our lifetimes, less little less racist, a little less [[01:48:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6531)] sexist, less homophobic, [[01:48:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6536)] little more generous, that, um, it was easy, I think, to say, "Well, yeah, I'm a I'm a progressive, but [[01:49:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6548)] it didn't really cost us anything." You know, we we could take positions on things that we thought were, um, [[01:49:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6556)] correct.

[[01:49:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6557)] **Marc Maron**: Correct.

[[01:49:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6557)] **Barack Obama**: But they were never really tested. And so, well, here here's the test. And and and and and [[01:49:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6565)] I think I think ultimately, a lot of people will pass, but I I think they haven't realized yet, no, [[01:49:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6572)] we're being tested right now. I I think people—and that includes young people—right? Like, I understand there are [[01:49:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6581)] consequences to the choices that we're making. If if you decide not to vote, that's a consequence. If if you [[01:49:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6589)] are a Hispanic man and you're you're frustrated about inflation, and so you decided, ah, you know what? All that [[01:49:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6596)] rhetoric about Trump doesn't matter. I'm just mad about inflation. And now, you know, your sons are being stopped in [[01:50:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6602)] L.A. because they look Latino, maybe incarcerated for a few days, and maybe, you know, without the ability to call [[01:50:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6612)] anybody, might just be locked up. Well, that's that's your that's a test there. There's a there's some clarity that's [[01:50:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6622)] that's coming about right now that I wish, you know, it'd be great if we weren't tested this way. But [[01:50:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6629)] you know what? It's, um, we probably need to be shaken out of our complacency anyway.

[[01:50:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6637)] **Marc Maron**: Yeah. And it it [[01:50:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6637)] what's interesting about the test and standing up and what you said the difference between fashion fashion and, uh, you [[01:50:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6644)] know, standing up is that people if people are comfortable in their own lives and and they can convince themselves [[01:50:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6652)] that it doesn't affect them. I mean, that's the biggest challenge.

[[01:50:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6655)] **Barack Obama**: Yeah. And and also, on the list of of [[01:51:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6660)] you know, universities and, uh, law firms and businesses is that, you know, corporations, yes, are are a different animal [[01:51:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6669)] in in relation to the bottom line and to whatever which way the wind blows politically. And that certainly with [[01:51:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6677)] the destruction of of DEI policy, they're not beholden to, uh, to tow a democratic line. And that that becomes [[01:51:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6684)] the biggest fear in terms of certain freedoms.

[[01:51:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6686)] **Barack Obama**: Well, look, I mean, we you saw what happened with Kimmel and [[01:51:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6692)] and I mean, the consolidation of media. It's interesting. We were talking about there there used to be sort of [[01:51:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6700)] a monoculture. Yeah. Three TV stations. Sure. And PBS. But, you know, be partly because it was coming out of [[01:51:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6711)] World War II. And I think people had been sufficiently scared and traumatized by what had happened in terms of [[01:52:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6720)] propaganda and Hitler and all this. Yeah, we set up a bunch of structures that created journalistic standards and fact-checking [[01:52:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6729)] and clear lines between opinion and fact and, uh, and and now we've got just as media is just as [[01:52:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6743)] concentrated, but none of the rules.

[[01:52:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6745)] **Marc Maron**: Right. Right.

[[01:52:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6746)] **Barack Obama**: And it can feed some of our worst impulses and and and [[01:52:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6749)] tell each segment of people, um, out there, uh, you know, just feed back their own biases and prejudices back [[01:52:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6758)] to them and and and make money on it. This whole point about corporations, this is something I've been [[01:52:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6764)] thinking a lot about also, is that, um, I do think so much of what's been driving political instability everywhere [[01:52:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6777)] is this widening, massive gulf in opportunity, wealth, income, right, uh, within countries, between countries. Um, I mean, the idea [[01:53:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6794)] that that some people now have three, 400 billion dollars on their way to a trillion dollars and you've got, uh, [[01:53:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6804)] you ordinary people still trying to figure out how to eat eat and and and pay the rent. Uh, in [[01:53:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6811)] that is driving a lot of this, right? And and part of what I think we have to spend more [[01:53:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6822)] time thinking about is some old-fashioned values that that aren't based just on money and how much you got and [[01:53:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6833)] material con, uh, you know, concerns. And and and I'm, uh, I am somebody who believes that, you know, market [[01:54:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6843)] based economics is actually not only the best way to create enough stuff for everybody to be okay, but I [[01:54:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6852)] also think it it's tied to freedom. State-run economics generally don't work pretty work very well. But so much of [[01:54:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6864)] our culture now, so much of what we teach our kids is geared around buying stuff and having stuff and [[01:54:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6872)] posting it on Instagram and then...

[[01:54:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6873)] **Marc Maron**: Right. It's it's winning to some.

[[01:54:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6876)] **Barack Obama**: Right. Winning is now defined solely by material [[01:54:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6885)] uh, goods, how much you got. And to some degree, fame that be that's become another currency.

[[01:54:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6891)] **Marc Maron**: Right. Right. [[01:54:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6893)] And...

[[01:54:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6893)] **Barack Obama**: And I do think part of what our conversation needs to be more about is and and it used to [[01:55:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6901)] come out of the church or, you know, out of, you know, um, the stories we told our kids was [[01:55:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6912)] this sense of, "Oh, you know what? Character matters. Honesty matters. Community and family and loyalty and kindness matters." Those [[01:55:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6925)] are the stories that [[01:55:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6929)] that's part of our political project, right, is is reaffirming that stuff. I I I think you were asking how [[01:55:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6940)] I navigated some of these, um, conflicts and and I'd get attacked from the right and I'd get attacked from [[01:55:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6949)] the left. One way I did that was trying to tell people what I really thought, but, you know, the [[01:55:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6956)] other thing was I actually had some pretty old-fashioned values, even if I had, you know, progressive or newfangled [[01:56:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6968)] ideas. You know, if I talked about trans issues, I wasn't talking to down to people and saying, "Oh, you're [[01:56:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6978)] a bigot." I'd say, "You know what? It's tough enough being a teenager. Let's treat all kids decently. Why would [[01:56:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6987)] we want to see kids bullied or shamed or shamed? Why wouldn't we want to do that? Why wouldn't we [[01:56:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=6993)] want to just, you know what? If it was our kid?" Right? And and I think spending more time talking [[01:56:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7003)] about why those values are important, um, not being cynical about them, not being ironic about it, yeah, but saying, [[01:56:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7012)] "No, no, that stuff matters."

[[01:56:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7014)] **Marc Maron**: Sure.

[[01:56:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7014)] **Barack Obama**: That would make a difference.

[[01:56:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7016)] **Marc Maron**: All right. Well, we've got our work cut out [[01:56:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7018)] for us.

[[01:56:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7019)] **Barack Obama**: You know what? I I think we're going to be okay. And I think that part of the [[01:57:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7025)] reason you had such a big fan base during this 16-year run is there was a core decency to you [[01:57:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7033)] and the conversations you had—maybe slightly edited by Brendan, yeah, thankfully—that that I I think speaks to who [[01:57:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7044)] we are. And, yeah, we can't take this stuff for granted. But I my my experience is most people are [[01:57:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7054)] really decent. And and and I think that's why when they hear somebody else who is, it it, uh, it [[01:57:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7062)] gives them courage and gives them hope and and, uh, you should be proud of having done that.

[[01:57:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7067)] **Marc Maron**: Well, thank [[01:57:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7067)] you, Mr. President.

[[01:57:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7068)] **Barack Obama**: And thank you.

[[01:57:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7068)] **Marc Maron**: And I'm I'm glad I made the trip. If you came to my house [[01:57:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7070)] the first time, I'll come here. And I hope to, uh, talk to you again. We'll meet, uh, halfway next [[01:57:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rKGfIOrM&t=7075)] time. Okay, buddy. Thanks, man. All right.
