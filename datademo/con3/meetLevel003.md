### Meeting Purpose



- Review PMM support structure and assignments for upcoming corporate events.
- Define and collate key product announcements from the past year for the upcoming Commit keynote.
- Clarify the methodology and scope for the Tier 1 competitive comparison spreadsheet.
- Review and finalize high-level messaging for a new messaging framework.

### Current Projects / Workstreams



- **Corporate Event Support:** GTM teams (Platform, CI/CD, GitOps) are assigned to "sponsor" and support specific events (ReInvent, Google Next, KubeCon).
- **Commit Product Announcements:** Compiling a list of major features (3 per stage) released since 13.0 that have reached maturity, to be used for keynotes.
- **Top 5 Overall Features:** Brainstorming a "Top 5 Overall" list from all stages, including UX, Vulnerability Management, and GitOps (K8s Agent, Terraform).
- **Tier 1 Competitive Sheet:** PMMs are filling out a competitive comparison limited to 5 Tier 1 competitors (ADO, Atlassian, GitHub, Jenkins, J-Frog, CloudBees).
- **Messaging Framework:** Finalizing three punchy, high-level messaging statements.



### Decisions (add timestamps if enabled)



- Event assignments are set: Platform on ReInvent, CI/CD on Google Next, and GitOps on KubeCon.
- Content and features from the 14.0 launch can be reused for the Commit product announcements.
- The product announcement list will be refined into a "Top 5 Overall" list for PR and keynote use.
- Vulnerability Management will be prioritized as the top security announcement over proprietary scanning.
- The competitive sheet comparison is limited to the defined Tier 1 competitors for this iteration.
- If a Tier 1 competitor is not applicable to a specific stage, they should be skipped for that stage.
- GitLab must be included as a line item in the competitive comparison sheet for an honest assessment.
- For platform competitors (e.g., GitHub, ADO), PMMs should explicitly list "0" capabilities for stages they do not cover (e.g., Monitor).
- The new competitive infographic will intentionally use a green-only color scale (no red) to position it as a "comparison" rather than an aggressive "competitive" piece.
- The messaging plank for security and velocity will be finalized as "More speed, less risk."



### Risks / Open Issues



- The formal event support process "isn't as nailed down as it needs to be," requiring the new GTM sponsorship tactic.
- Creating "product announcements" for GitLab is difficult because the public roadmap means features have been known for a while.
- External audiences do not understand internal stage names (e.g., Monitor, Configure, Manage), a known issue being deferred to a future iteration of competitive assets.
