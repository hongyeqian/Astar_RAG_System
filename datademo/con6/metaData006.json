        "Views the GPU as a 'time machine' that accelerates applications, allowing scientists (e.g., in quantum chemistry) to do their life's work within their lifetime.",
        "Created the CUDA platform to make parallel processing accessible to all programmers, not just graphics experts.",
        "Bet on deep learning after the AlexNet breakthrough (2012), re-engineering the entire computing stack (e.g., DGX).",
        "Invested tens of billions of dollars over 10 years based on the core belief in accelerated computing before the AI boom materialized.",
        "Core belief: Deep learning networks (DNNs) can scale and learn from almost any data modality (text, images, amino acids, video, robot actions).",
        "Developed Omniverse (physics simulator) and Cosmos (world foundation model) to train robots in realistic, physically-grounded digital worlds.",
        "Improved the energy efficiency of its AI computing by 10,000 times in the 8 years since 2016.",
        "Maintains a core belief in flexible, general-purpose architectures that can support future, unknown AI algorithms, rather than over-specializing hardware for one (like Transformers).",
        "The GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics card uses AI to predict most of the pixels on a screen, computing only 500k pixels and using AI to generate the other ~7.5 million.",
        "Created a smaller, $3,000 'baby DGX' AI supercomputer to make AI development accessible to students and all engineers."
