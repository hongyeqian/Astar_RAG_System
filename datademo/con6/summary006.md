# Summary

In an interview with Cleo Abram, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang details the fundamental computing shift his company led, starting with the insight into parallel processing (GPU) for video games, which evolved with the creation of the CUDA platform. This platform unlocked GPUs for general-purpose computing, directly enabling the 2012 AlexNet deep learning breakthrough and prompting Huang's decade-long bet to "reinvent computing" for the AI era. Huang outlines his vision for the future, where "everything that moves will be robotic"; he explains that these physical AI systems will be trained in digital twin simulators like Omniverse (for physics) and Cosmos (a "world foundation model") to gain physical common sense. He discusses AI safety concerns (bias, hallucination, redundancy), identifies energy efficiency as the primary physical limit to computing, and explains why Nvidia favors general-purpose architectures over specialized chips to enable future innovation. Huang concludes by advising everyone to get an "AI tutor" and learn to prompt AI, persistently asking, "How can I use AI to do my job better?" to ultimately become "superhuman".
