# Summary

In an interview at TED2023, TikTok CEO Shou Chew joined Chris Anderson to discuss the platform's core technology, safety policies, and the major national security concerns surrounding it. Chew defined TikTok's mission as inspiring creativity and bringing joy, attributing its success to a "discovery engine" based on an interest graph and pattern recognition ("math"), rather than a traditional social graph. He addressed user addiction by highlighting proactive "get off" videos and a 60-minute default time limit for users under 18. On content moderation, he noted that "tens of thousands" of people enforce Community Guidelines, which include restrictions for teens. In response to U.S. concerns about data and Chinese influence, Chew detailed "Project Texas" as an "unprecedented project" to localize American data on U.S. soil, managed by Oracle, stating that new U.S. data is already stored there and legacy data would be deleted "this year". He further committed to keeping the platform free from "any government manipulation" and ensuring transparency by allowing third parties to review the source code.
