### Meeting Purpose



- To understand Shou Chew's story and how he came to lead TikTok.
- To explore the core concepts of TikTok's recommendation algorithm (interest graph vs. social graph).
- To discuss the platform's benefits, such as creator discovery (e.g., Khaby Lame) and the rise of STEM content.
- To address risks, including user addiction, content moderation, and challenges to teenage mental health.
- To address U.S. political concerns over data privacy, Chinese ownership (ByteDance), and Project Texas.
- To discuss TikTok's 5-year vision for discovery, AI-powered creation, and commerce.



### Acronyms & Orgs (Normalized)



- **TikTok** – TikTok
- **ByteDance** – ByteDance (TikTok's parent company)
- **Oracle** – Oracle (Project Texas partner)
- **Douyin** – Douyin (Separate app in China)
- **AI** – Artificial Intelligence



### Capability Highlights (by org)



**TikTok**

- Core premise (10 years ago) was to recommend content based on what users *like*, not who they *know* (social graph).
- Mission: "Inspire creativity and to bring joy".
- Vision: Provide 1) a window to discover, 2) a canvas to create (using new AI), and 3) bridges to connect.
- Recommendation algorithm is "just math" (collaborative filtering); if User A and B like the same 3 videos, they will be shown each other's other liked videos.
- Users "vote with their thumbs" by watching, swiping, liking, or sharing, which provides interest signals to the algorithm.
- Format is optimized for smartphones (full-screen portrait video) as a "window to discover".
- Gives everyday people (e.g., Khaby Lame, small businesses) a platform to be discovered based on talent, not prior fame.
- STEM content has over 116 billion views; "BookTok" has 120 billion views.
- Employs tens of thousands of people (based in Ireland) plus machines for content moderation.
- Offers "Family Pairing" tools for parents to link to their teen's account and set time limits.



### Current Projects / Workstreams



- **Project Texas:** Localizing U.S. data to be stored on U.S. soil (Oracle Cloud) and overseen by U.S. personnel.
- **Legacy Data Deletion:** Deleting legacy U.S. data from servers in Virginia and Singapore; expected to be done "this year".
- **Screen Time Management:** Proactively sends videos telling users to "get off the platform" if they spend too much time.
- **Teen Safety Defaults:** A 60-minute default time limit is set for users under 18.
- **STEM Feed:** Actively testing a dedicated feed in the U.S. just for STEM content.
- **Source Code Transparency:** Allowing third-party reviewers to come in and review TikTok's source code.
- **Research Tools:** Releasing more tools for researchers to study the platform's content (the "output").



### Overlaps vs. Unique Contributions



- **Overlaps:**
  - The industry faces common issues with bad actors and the need for content moderation.
  - The industry shares the challenge of balancing user privacy with the need for accurate age verification.
  - TikTok is not the only company to rely on a global talent pool, including engineers in China.
- **Unique to TikTok:**
  - Built from the start on an "interest algorithm" (recommendation) as the main use case, unlike others built for search or social graphs.
  - Project Texas is an "unprecedented project" for localizing data beyond what other companies have done.
  - Allowing third-party reviewers to inspect the source code to ensure no manipulation.



### Proposed Collaboration Path



- **Discovery (Future Vision):** Continue expanding discovery beyond entertainment into areas like STEM (116B views) and "BookTok" (120B views).
- **Creation (Future Vision):** Utilize generative AI to help people (e.g., those bad at drawing) unleash creativity in new ways.
- **Connection (Future Vision):** Expand bridges for commerce and support for small businesses (currently 5 million in the U.S.).



### Decisions



- **15:15** – Decided that executives cannot make ad hoc moderation calls; all follow Community Guidelines.

- **15:40** – Decided to enforce strict bans on pornography, CSAM, and violence.

- **16:02** – Decided to provide a differentiated experience for users under 18.

- **16:09** – Users below 16 are restricted from going viral or using instant messaging.

- **21:00** – Decided to proactively remind users to take breaks if spending too much time on the platform.

- **21:11** – Decided to set a 60-minute default limit for users under 18.

- **22:01** – Adopted the 60-minute policy based on advice from Boston Children’s Hospital Digital Wellness Lab.

- **26:34** – Banned dangerous challenges and unsafe content trends.

- **28:42** – Proactively removes mature themes from teenage experience to reduce insecurity.

- **30:55** – Committed to Project Texas: localizing U.S. data on Oracle Cloud under U.S. oversight.

- **33:35** – Reaffirmed TikTok’s commitment to freedom of expression and independence from government influence.

- **33:52** – Committed to transparency and third-party monitoring.

- **33:58** – Allowed third-party reviewers to inspect TikTok’s source code for manipulation or backdoors.



### Risks / Open Issues



- **00:21** – A bipartisan consensus exists in U.S. politics to ban TikTok.
- **02:20** – The platform is perceived as having a "different level of addiction" compared to other media.
- **16:56** – Industry-wide challenge of balancing the need for accurate age verification with user privacy (e.g., face scans).
- **20:16** – Public perception that TikTok maximizes ad-time engagement (Chew clarified this is *not* the company’s goal).
- **24:07** – A misconception exists that the Chinese version (Douyin) has stricter child safety rules than the U.S. version (which Chew claims is more restrictive).
- **25:02** – Concern that the "race for attention" pushes creators, especially teenage girls, toward sexualized content.
- **26:14** – Risk of harmful trends, like the "devious licks" vandalism challenge, going viral.
- **28:10** – Concern that the platform amplifies insecurities, inadequacy, depression, and body image issues, especially for teenagers.
- **29:28** – U.S. Congress concern: Data of U.S. users (owned by Chinese company ByteDance) could be requested by the Chinese government.
- **29:48** – Confirmed instances of U.S. journalist data being made available to ByteDance engineers.
- **31:29** – The push for "digital sovereignty" (like Project Texas) risks the "balkanization of the internet" if interoperability is lost.
- **32:25** – Ongoing engineering challenge: deleting legacy U.S. data from Virginia and Singapore servers (“a very big engineering effort”) — operational risk until completion.
- **32:50** – Hypothetical scenario raised that the Chinese government could try to influence a U.S. election or "cause civil war" by manipulating the algorithm.
