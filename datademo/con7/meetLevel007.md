## **Transcript Summary**

At TED2023, **Chris Anderson** (Head of TED) interviewed **Shou Chew** (CEO of TikTok) about the platform's explosive growth, its underlying mechanics, and the significant controversies surrounding it.

Chew described TikTok's mission as inspiring creativity and bringing joy [00:02:56], attributing its success to its **interest-based recommendation algorithm** rather than a traditional social graph [00:01:45]. He emphasized how this "discovery engine" gives anyone, like creator Khaby Lame, a chance to be seen [00:04:19].

Anderson challenged Chew on critical issues, including **user addiction and screen time** [00:20:07], the platform's responsibility for **content moderation** (e.g., dangerous challenges, teen mental health) [00:25:22], [00:28:20], and the paramount U.S. national security concern regarding **data privacy, ByteDance (its Chinese parent company), and potential Chinese government influence** [00:29:28].

Chew detailed **"Project Texas"** as the comprehensive solution to U.S. data concerns, involving localizing U.S. data on Oracle servers [00:31:01], and affirmed his commitment to transparency and keeping the platform free from any government manipulation [00:33:35], [00:33:52].

## **Key Topics**

### **1. The Recommendation "Discovery Engine"**

- TikTok's algorithm is built to "inspire creativity and bring joy" by functioning as a "window to discover" [00:02:56], [00:03:14].
- It is based on an **interest graph** (content you like) rather than a social graph (people you know) [00:01:45].
- Chew describes the algorithm as "just math"—a pattern-recognition system that uses user signals (likes, watch time, shares) to find similar content preferences among users [00:05:54], [00:07:27].
- This model allows everyday users with talent, like **Khaby Lame**, to be discovered without needing existing followers [00:04:19].

### **2. Addiction and Screen Time Management**

- Chew stated the company's goal is *not* to maximize time spent, arguing a "healthy relationship" with the app is better for long-term business [00:20:37], [00:23:26].
- The platform proactively sends videos telling users to "get off the platform" after extended use [00:21:00].
- By default, users **under 18 have a 60-minute time limit**, a figure recommended by Boston Children's Hospital [00:21:18], [00:22:01].
- A "Family Pairing" feature allows parents to set time limits for their teenagers [00:21:28].

### **3. Content Moderation and Safety**

- The company employs "tens of thousands" of people plus machines to enforce its **Community Guidelines** [00:15:15], [00:27:30].
- Clear rules prohibit content like pornography, violence, and dangerous challenges [00:15:48], [00:26:34].
- A differentiated, more restrictive experience is provided for users under 18, including blocking DMs for under-16s and live streaming for under-18s [00:16:02], [00:16:17].
- When asked about teen mental health and sexualized content, Chew stated that mature themes are proactively removed from teenagers' experiences [00:25:31], [00:28:42].

### **4. Data, China, and "Project Texas"**

- Anderson directly addressed U.S. concerns about data access by ByteDance and potential Chinese government manipulation [00:29:28].
- Chew's solution is **Project Texas**, an "unprecedented project" to localize American data [00:30:55].
- All new U.S. data is stored on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure** on U.S. soil, "overseen by American personnel" [00:31:01], [00:32:11].
- Legacy U.S. data was in the process of being deleted from servers in Virginia and Singapore, with a target completion of "this year" (2023) [00:32:19], [00:32:39].

### **5. Election Integrity and Transparency**

- When pressed on hypothetical Chinese government interference in a U.S. election, Chew committed to keeping TikTok "free from any government manipulation" [00:33:35], [00:33:40].
- He stressed that the solution is "an unprecedented amount of transparency," including **allowing third-party reviewers to audit TikTok's source code** [00:33:52], [00:33:58].

## **Action Items**

- Continue to prioritize platform safety, especially for teenage users [00:25:49].
- Complete the deletion of legacy U.S. data from Virginia and Singapore servers as part of Project Texas [00:32:19], [00:32:39].
- Uphold commitment to freedom of expression and prevent any government manipulation [00:33:35], [00:33:40].
- Implement third-party source code review and monitoring to ensure transparency and platform integrity [00:33:52], [00:33:58].
