[#P001] [[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=0)] **Chris Anderson**: It's very nice to have you here. Let's see. First of all, you know, congratulations. You really pulled off something [[00:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=6)] remarkable on that grilling. You achieved something that very few people do, which was you pulled off a kind [[00:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=12)] of a bipartisan consensus in U.S. politics. That was great. You know, the bad news was that that consensus largely seemed [[00:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=21)] to be "we must ban TikTok." So, we're going to come to that in a bit, and I'm curious [[00:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=26)] about... but before we before we go there, we need to know about you. You seem to me [[00:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=32)] like a remarkable person. I want to know a bit of your story and how you came to TikTok [[00:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=36)] in the first place.

[#P002] [[00:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=36)] **Shou Chew**: Okay, thank you, Chris. Before we do that, can I just check, I need [[00:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=41)] to know my audience. How many of you here use TikTok? Just... oh, thank you. For those who don't, [[00:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=46)] the Wi-Fi is free. So, that's another question, which is, how many of you here have had your lives touched [[00:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=55)] through TikTok, through your kids and other people in your lives? I mean, it's... oh, that's great to see. [[01:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=61)] It's basically, if you're alive, you have had some kind of contact with TikTok at this point.

[#P003] [[01:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=66)] **Chris Anderson**: Thank you. Tell us about you.

[#P004] [[01:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=67)] **Shou Chew**: So, my name is Shou, and I'm from Singapore. Roughly 10 years ago, I [[01:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=73)] met with two engineers who were building a product, and the idea behind this was to build a product that [[01:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=81)] recommended content to people not based on who they knew, which was—if you think about it 10 years [[01:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=86)] ago, it was all the social graph was all in the rage, and the idea was, you know, your content [[01:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=93)] and the feed that you saw should be based on people that you knew. You know, about 10 years ago, [[01:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=97)] these two engineers thought about something different, which is, instead of showing you what you knew, instead of [[01:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=105)] showing you people you knew, why don't we show you content that you liked? And that's sort of the genesis [[01:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=110)] and the birth of the early iterations of TikTok. And about five years ago with the [[01:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=116)] advent of, you know, 4G, short video, mobile phone penetration, TikTok was born. And a couple of years [[02:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=124)] ago, you know, I had the opportunity to run this company, and it still excites me every single day. So...

[#P005] [[02:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=130)] **Chris Anderson**: I want to dig in a little more into this about what was it that made this takeoff so explicit, [[02:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=135)] because the language I hear from people who spend time on it, it's sort of like— [[02:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=140)] I mean, it is a different level of addiction to other media out there, and I don't necessarily mean [[02:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=148)] this in a good way. We'll be coming on to it. There's good and bad things about this type of [[02:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=152)] addiction. But it's the feeling that within a couple days of experience of TikTok, it knows you [[02:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=158)] and it surprises you with things that you didn't know you were going to be interested in, but [[02:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=162)] you are. How is it really just instead of the social graph? What are these algorithms doing?

[#P006] [[02:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=169)] **Shou Chew**: I think to describe this, to begin to answer your question, we have to talk about the mission of the company. [[02:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=176)] Now, the mission is to inspire creativity and to bring joy. And I think, you know, missions for companies like [[03:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=182)] ours is really important because you have product managers working on the product every single day, and they need to [[03:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=188)] have a North Star, you know, something to sort of work towards together. Now, based on this mission, our vision [[03:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=194)] is to provide three things to our users. We want to provide a window to discover, and I'll talk about [[03:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=200)] discovery you talked about this in a second. We want to give them a canvas to create, which is going [[03:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=205)] to be really exciting with new technologies in AI that's going to help people create new [[03:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=211)] things. And the final thing is bridges for people to connect. So that's sort of the vision of what we're [[03:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=217)] trying to build. Now, what really makes TikTok very unique and very different is the whole discovery engine behind [[03:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=225)] us. So, there are earlier apps that I have a lot of respect for, but they were built for a [[03:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=229)] different purpose. You know, for example, in the era of search, there was an app that was built [[03:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=235)] for people who wanted to search things, so that it's more easily found. And then in the era [[04:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=241)] of social graphs, it was about connecting people and their followers. Now, what we have done is that we are [[04:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=247)] based on our machine learning algorithms, we're showing people what they like. And what this means is that we have [[04:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=253)] given the everyday person a platform to be discovered. If you have talent, it is very, very easy to get [[04:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=259)] discovered on TikTok. And I'll just give you one example of this. The biggest creator on TikTok [[04:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=265)] is a guy called Khaby Lame. Khaby was from Senegal. He lives in Italy. He was a factory worker. [[04:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=273)] For the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos, but what he did was, [[04:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=278)] he had talent, he was funny, he had a good expression, he had creativity, so he kept posting. And [[04:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=284)] today, he has 160 million followers on our platform. So, every single day we hear stories like that, you know, [[04:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=290)] businesses, people with talent. And I think it's very, it's very freeing to have a platform where as long as [[04:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=296)] you have talent, you're going to be heard, and you have the chance to succeed, and that's what we're providing [[05:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=301)] to our users.

[#P007] [[05:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=301)] **Chris Anderson**: So, this is the amazing thing to me. We've, most of us have grown [[05:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=306)] up with say, network television, where for decades, you've had thousands of brilliant creative people toiling in the [[05:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=313)] trenches trying to imagine stuff that will be amazing for an audience, and none of them ever remotely came up [[05:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=322)] with anything that looked like many of your creators. So, these algorithms, by just by observing people's behavior [[05:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=332)] and what they look like, have discovered things that thousands of brilliant humans never discovered. Tell me some of the [[05:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=338)] things that it is looking at. So, obvious things like if someone presses like or stays on a video for [[05:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=344)] a long time, that gives you a clue, "more like that." But is it subject matter? What are [[05:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=349)] the array of things that you have noticed that you can actually track that provide useful [[05:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=354)] clues?

[#P008] [[05:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=354)] **Shou Chew**: The, I'm going to simplify this a lot, but the machine learning, the recommendation algorithm is really just math. [[06:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=361)] So, for example, if you, if you like videos one, two, three, and four, and I like videos one, two, [[06:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=368)] three, and five, maybe he liked videos one, two, three, and six. Now, what's going to happen is because we [[06:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=373)] like one, two, three at the same time, he's going to be shown four, five, six, and so are we. [[06:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=377)] And you can think about this repeated at scale in real time across more than a billion people. That's basically [[06:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=384)] what it is. It's math. And of course, AI and machine learning has allowed this to be [[06:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=389)] done at a very, very big scale. And what we have seen the result of this is that they learned [[06:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=394)] the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content that's really relevant for you in a very, [[06:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=401)] in a very quick way.

[#P009] [[06:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=401)] **Chris Anderson**: So, it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying. That the theory [[06:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=408)] behind it is that these humans are weird people. We don't really know what they're interested in, but if [[06:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=412)] we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else, chances are, you know, you can [[06:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=418)] you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlapped human's repertoire to feed [[07:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=425)] them, and they'll be surprised, but the reason they like it is because their peer also liked it.

[#P010] [[07:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=429)] **Shou Chew**: It is [[07:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=430)] pattern recognition based on your interest signals. And I think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask [[07:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=436)] you 20 questions on whether you like a piece of content, you know, "what are your interests?" We don't do [[07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=440)] that. We build that experience organically into the app experience. So, you are voting with your thumbs. You know, by [[07:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=447)] watching a video, by swiping it, by liking it, by sharing it, you are basically exhibiting interest signals. [[07:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=454)] And what it does mathematically is to take those signals, put it in a formula, and then matches it through [[07:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=459)] pattern recognition. That's basically the idea behind it.

[#P011] [[07:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=460)] **Chris Anderson**: I mean, lots of startups have tried to use these types [[07:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=468)] of techniques. I'm wondering what else played a role early on? I mean, how big a deal was it that [[07:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=472)] from the get-go you were optimizing for smartphones so that videos were shot in portrait format, and they [[07:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=479)] were short? Was that, was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered?

[#P012] [[08:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=484)] **Shou Chew**: I think we were the first to really [[08:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=485)] try this at scale. The recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the [[08:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=492)] platform is so popular among so many people, but beyond that, you know, you mentioned the format itself. So, [[08:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=500)] we talked about the vision of the company, which is to have a window to discover, and if you sort [[08:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=505)] of just open that for the first time, you see that it takes up your whole screen. So that's the [[08:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=508)] window that we want. You can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their [[08:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=513)] lives. Then, you know, through this recommendation algorithm, we have found that it connects people together, people find communities. And [[08:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=521)] I've heard so many stories of people who have found their communities because of the content that they're posting. Now, [[08:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=527)] I'll give you an example. I was in D.C. recently, and I met with a bunch of creators. [[08:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=533)] So, one of them was sitting next to me at the dinner. His name is Samuel. He [[09:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=540)] runs a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, and it's a taco restaurant. He told me he has never done this before, [[09:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=546)] first venture. He started posting all this content on TikTok, and I saw his content. [[09:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=552)] It looks... I was hungry after looking at it. It's just great content. And he's generated so much [[09:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=557)] interest in his business. Last year, he made something like a million dollars in revenue just via TikTok. [[09:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=563)] One restaurant. And again and again, I hear these stories. By connecting people together, by giving people the [[09:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=570)] window to discover, we have given many small businesses and many people, your common person, a voice that they will [[09:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=577)] never otherwise have, and I think that's the power of the platform.

[#P013] [[09:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=582)] **Chris Anderson**: So, you definitely have identified early just how [[09:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=584)] we're social creatures, we need affirmation. I've heard a story—and you can tell me whether true or [[09:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=590)] not—that one of the keys to your early lift-off was that you wanted to persuade creators who were trying [[09:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=596)] out TikTok that this was a platform where they would get response early on. When you're trying [[10:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=602)] to grow something, the numbers aren't there for response. So, you had the brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a [[10:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=609)] bit, basically finding ways to give people a bigger sense of like, more likes, more engagement than was [[10:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=614)] actually the case by using AI agents somehow in the process. Is that a brilliant idea, or is [[10:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=621)] that just a myth?

[#P014] [[10:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=622)] **Shou Chew**: I would describe it in a different [[10:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=625)] way. So, there are other platforms that exist before TikTok, and if you think about those platforms, [[10:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=631)] you sort of have to be famous already in order to get followers because the way it's built is that [[10:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=637)] people come and follow people, and if you are not really famous, the chances that you get [[10:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=642)] discovered are very, very low. Now, what we have done, again, because of the difference in the way we're recommending [[10:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=649)] content, is that we've given anyone, any single person with enough talent, a stage to be able to be discovered. [[10:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=656)] And I think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform. [[11:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=662)] And again and again, you will hear stories from people who use the platform, who post regularly on it, that [[11:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=668)] if they have something they want to say, the platform gives them the chance and the stage to connect with [[11:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=673)] their audience in a way that I think no other product in the past has ever offered them.

[#P015] [[11:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=677)] **Chris Anderson**: So, I'm [[11:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=679)] just trying to play back what you said there. You said you were describing a different way. [[11:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=683)] What I what I said is, is it then the case that like, to give someone a decent chance—someone [[11:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=689)] who's brilliant but doesn't come with any followers initially—that you, you've got some technique to identify talent, [[11:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=696)] and that you will almost encourage them, you will give them some kind of [[11:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=700)] artificially increase the number of followers or likes or whatever that they have so that others are encouraged [[11:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=706)] to go, "wow, there's something there," and so forth. Like, it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every [[11:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=710)] entrepreneur, every party planner kind of knows about of, "no, no, this is the hot place in town, everyone come," [[11:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=715)] and that is how you actually gain critical mass.

[#P016] [[11:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=717)] **Shou Chew**: We want to make sure that every person who posts [[12:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=722)] a video is given an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with, but this [[12:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=727)] idea that you are maybe alluding to that we can get people to like something, it doesn't really work like [[12:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=735)] that.

[#P017] [[12:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=735)] **Chris Anderson**: But can you get, could you get AI agents to like something? Could you see the network work with [[12:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=740)] extra AI agents that could kind of, you know, give someone early encouragement?

[#P018] [[12:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=744)] **Shou Chew**: Ultimately, what the machine does is it [[12:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=747)] recognizes people's interests. So, if you post something that's not interesting to a lot of people, even if you gave [[12:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=752)] it a lot of exposure, you're not going to get the virality that you want. Whereas, so it's a lot [[12:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=758)] of, you know, there is no, there's no push here. It's not like you can go and [[12:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=762)] push something because I like Chris, I'm going to push your content, and it doesn't work like that. [[12:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=767)] You've got to have a message that resonates with people, and if it does, then it will automatically just have [[12:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=772)] the virality itself. That's the beauty of user-generated content. It's not something that can be engineered or over [[13:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=780)] thought. It really is something that has to resonate with the audience, and if it does, then it [[13:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=785)] goes viral.

[#P019] [[13:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=785)] **Chris Anderson**: I was speaking privately with an investor who knows your company quite well, who said [[13:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=791)] that actually the level of sophistication of the algorithms you have going is just another order of [[13:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=798)] magnitude to what competitors like Facebook or YouTube have going. Is that, is that just hype, or [[13:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=805)] do you, do you really believe you, like, how complex are these algorithms?

[#P020] [[13:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=808)] **Shou Chew**: Well, I think in terms of complexity, [[13:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=813)] there are many companies with a lot of resources and a lot of talent, you know, they will figure out [[13:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=817)] the, even the most complex algorithms. I think what is very different is your mission of your company, [[13:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=823)] how you started the company. Like I said, we started with this idea that this was the main [[13:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=829)] use case, the most important use case, is you come and you get to see recommended content. Now, for some [[13:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=835)] other apps out there, they are very significant and have a lot of users, they're built for a different original [[14:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=840)] purpose. And if you're built for something different, then your users are used to that because the community comes in [[14:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=846)] and they expect that sort of experience. So, I think the pivot away from that, it's not, it's not really [[14:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=851)] just a matter of engineering and algorithms. It's a matter of what your company is built to begin with, which [[14:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=858)] is why I started this by saying you need to have a vision, you need to have a mission, and [[14:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=862)] that's the North Star where you can't just shift it halfway, right?

[#P021] [[14:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=865)] **Chris Anderson**: And is it fair to say that [[14:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=867)] because your start point has been interest algorithms rather than social graph algorithms, you've been able to avoid some of [[14:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=873)] the worst of the sort of the filter bubbles that have happened in other social media where you have tribes [[14:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=878)] kind of declaring war on each other effectively, and so much of the noise and energy is around [[14:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=884)] that? Do you believe that you've largely avoided that on TikTok?

[#P022] [[14:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=886)] **Shou Chew**: The diversity of content that our users [[14:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=891)] see is very key, you know, in order for the discovery—and the mission is to discover, so, sorry, [[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=0)] the vision is to discover. So, in order to facilitate that, it is very important to us that what the [[15:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=903)] users see is the diversity of content. Now, generally speaking, you know, there are certain issues that you mentioned [[15:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=910)] that the industry faces. You know, there are some bad actors who come on the internet, they post bad content. [[15:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=915)] Our approach is that we have very clear Community Guidelines. We're very transparent about what is allowed and [[15:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=922)] what is not allowed on our platform. No executives make any ad hoc decisions. And based on that, we have [[15:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=928)] built a team that is tens of thousands of people plus machines in order to identify content that is bad [[15:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=935)] and actively and proactively remove it from the platform.

[#P023] [[15:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=938)] **Chris Anderson**: Talk about what some of those key guidelines are.

[#P024] [[15:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=940)] **Shou Chew**: We have [[15:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=942)] it published on our website. We just, in March, we just iterated a new version to make it [[15:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=948)] more readable. So, there are many things, like, for example, no pornography, clearly no child sexual abuse material, and [[15:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=955)] other bad things, no violence, for example. We also make it clear that there's a differentiated experience if you're below [[16:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=962)] 18 years old. So, if you're below 18 years, for example, your entire app experience is actually more restricted. [[16:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=969)] We don't allow, as an example, users below 16 by default to go viral. We don't allow that. If you're [[16:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=977)] below 16, we don't allow you to use the instant messaging feature in-app. If you're below 18, we [[16:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=984)] don't allow you to use the live streaming features. And of course, we give parents a whole set of tools [[16:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=988)] to control their teenagers' experience as well.

[#P025] [[16:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=992)] **Chris Anderson**: But how do you how do you know the age of your users?

[#P026] [[16:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=994)] **Shou Chew**: In our industry, we do. We rely mainly on something called age-gating, which is when you sign up for [[16:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1000)] the app for the first time, and we ask you for the age. Now, beyond that, we also have [[16:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1006)] we also have built tools to go through your public profile. For example, when you post a video, we try and [[16:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1011)] match what the age that you said with the video that you just posted. Now, there are questions of, "can [[16:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1016)] we do more?" And that question is always, for every company, by the way, in our industry, has to [[17:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1022)] be balanced with privacy. Now, if, for example, you know, we scan the faces of every single user, [[17:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1029)] then, you know, we will significantly increase the ability to tell their age, but we will also significantly increase [[17:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1035)] the amount of data that we collect on you. Now, we don't want to collect data, we don't want to [[17:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1039)] scan data on your face to collect that. So, that balance has to be maintained, and it's a challenge that [[17:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1044)] we are working through together with, you know, industry, together with the regulators as well.

[#P027] [[17:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1048)] **Chris Anderson**: So, look, one thing that [[17:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1051)] is unquestionable is that you have created a platform for literally millions of people who never thought they were [[17:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1056)] going to be a content creator, you've given them an audience. I'd actually like to hear from you one other [[17:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1062)] favorite example of someone who TikTok has given an audience to that never had that before.

[#P028] [[17:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1066)] **Shou Chew**: I think, [[17:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1068)] you know, so when, again, when I meet with, when I travel around the world, I meet with [[17:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1072)] a whole bunch of creators on our platform. I was in South Korea just yesterday, and before that, [[17:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1079)] I met with, before that, I met with a bunch of people. Don't expect, for example, teachers. There [[18:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1085)] is an English teacher from Arkansas, her name is Claudine, and I met her in person. She uses her platform [[18:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1092)] to reach out to students. You know, there is another teacher called Chemical Kin, and Chemical Kim teaches chemistry. [[18:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1100)] What she does is she uses our platform to reach out to a much broader student base than she has in [[18:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1105)] her classroom. And they're both very, very popular. In fact, what we have realized is that STEM content [[18:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1114)] has over 116 billion views on our platform globally, and is so significant—a cumulative 160 billion is [[18:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1124)] so significant—that in the U.S. we have started testing creating a feed just for STEM content, just for STEM [[18:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1131)] content. I've been using it for a while and I learned something new. You want to know what it is? [[18:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1136)] Apparently, if you flip an egg, you know, on your tray, the egg will last longer. It's science! There's a [[19:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1144)] whole video on this. I learned this on TikTok. You can search for this. You want to [[19:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1147)] know something else about an egg? If you put it in just one hand and squeeze it as hard as [[19:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1151)] you can, it will never break.

[#P029] [[19:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1152)] **Chris Anderson**: Yes, I think I read about that too. It's not somewhere we can search [[19:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1159)] for it. But look, here's the flip side to all this amazingness, and it's really, it's honestly, this is the [[19:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1166)] key thing that I want to have an honest conversation with you because it's such an important issue. [[19:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1172)] This question of human addiction. You know, we are animals with a prefrontal cortex, that's how I think of us. [[19:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1183)] We have these addictive instincts that go back millions of years, and we often are in the [[19:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1190)] mode of trying to modulate our own behavior. It turns out that the internet is incredibly good at [[19:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1199)] activating our animal selves and getting them so damn excited. And your company, the company you've built, is better [[20:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1207)] at it than any other company on the planet, I think. So, what are the risks of this? I mean, [[20:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1216)] how, from a company point of view, for example, it's in your interest to have people on there as [[20:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1223)] long as possible. So, some would say, is the first pass you want people to be addicted as long as [[20:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1228)] possible. That's how advertising money will flow and so forth, and that's how your creators will be delighted. What is [[20:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1237)] too much?

[#P030] [[20:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1237)] **Shou Chew**: I don't actually agree with that. As a company, our goal is not to optimize [[20:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1243)] and maximize time spent, it is not. In fact, in order to address people spending too much time on our [[20:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1250)] platform, we have done a number of things. I was just speaking with some of your colleagues backstage. One [[20:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1255)] of them, Tony, you know, she has encountered this as well. If you spend too much time on our platform, [[21:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1260)] we will proactively send you videos to tell you to get off the platform. We will, and depending [[21:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1267)] on the time of the day, if it's late at night, it will come sooner. We have also built in tools [[21:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1271)] to limit. If you're below 18 years old, by default, we set a 60 minute default time limit.

[#P031] [[21:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1278)] **Chris Anderson**: How many? 60 minutes?

[#P032] [[21:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1278)] **Shou Chew**: 60 minutes. And we've given parents tools and yourself tools. If you go to settings, you can set [[21:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1283)] your own time limit. We've given parents tools so that you can pair—for the parents who don't know [[21:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1288)] this, go to settings, "Family Pairing"—you can pair your phone with your teenager's phone and set the time limit. [[21:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1294)] And we really encourage parents to have these conversations with their teenagers on what is the right amount of screen [[21:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1299)] time. I think there's a healthy relationship that you should have with your screen, and as a business, [[21:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1304)] we believe that that balance needs to be met. So, it's not true that we just want to maximize time spent.

[#P033] [[21:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1309)] **Chris Anderson**: If you were advising parents here what time they should actually recommend to their teenagers, what [[21:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1316)] do you think is the right setting?

[#P034] [[21:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1317)] **Shou Chew**: Well, 60 minutes, we did not come up with it ourselves. So, I [[22:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1321)] went to the Digital Wellness Lab at the Boston Children's Hospital, and we had this conversation with them, [[22:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1325)] and 60 minutes was the recommendation that they gave to us, which is why we built this into the app. [[22:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1330)] Now, so 60 minutes, take it for what it is. It's something that we've had some discussions [[22:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1335)] with experts, but I think for all parents here, it is very important to have these conversations with your teenage [[22:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1341)] children, and help them, help them develop a healthy relationship with screens. I think we live in an [[22:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1347)] age where it's completely inevitable that we're going to interact with screens and digital content, but I [[22:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1354)] think we should develop healthy habits early on in life, and that's something I would encourage.

[#P035] [[22:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1358)] **Chris Anderson**: I'm curious to ask [[22:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1360)] the audience, which of you have ever had that video on TikTok appear saying, "Come on, [[22:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1368)] I mean..." Okay, so maybe a third of the audience seem to be active TikTok users, and about 20 people [[22:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1376)] maybe put their hands up there. So, are you sure that, like, it feels to me like this [[23:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1381)] is a great, this is a great thing to have, and but isn't there always going [[23:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1388)] to be a temptation in any given quarter or whatever to just push it a bit at the boundary and [[23:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1394)] just dial back a bit on that so that you can hit revenue goals, etc., etc.? Are you saying that this is used scrupulously?

[#P036] [[23:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1403)] **Shou Chew**: I think, you know, in terms, even if you think [[23:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1406)] about it from a commercial point of view, it is always best when your customers have a very healthy relationship [[23:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1411)] with your product. It's always best when it's healthy. So, if you think about very short-term retention, maybe, but I [[23:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1418)] don't think that's not the way we think about it. If you think about it from a longer term perspective, [[23:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1422)] what you really want to have is a healthy relationship. You don't want people to be [[23:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1427)] to develop very unhealthy habits, and then at some point they're going to drop it, right? No, so I [[23:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1431)] think everything in moderation.

[#P037] [[23:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1433)] **Chris Anderson**: There's a claim out there that in China there's a much more rigorous [[23:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1438)] standards imposed on the amount of time that children, especially, can spend on the...

[#P038] [[24:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1447)] **Shou Chew**: That is, unfortunately, a very, it's a misconception. So, that experience that is being mentioned for Douyin, which is a [[24:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1454)] different app, is for an under 14 year old experience. Now, if you compare that in the United States, we [[24:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1461)] have under 13 experience in the U.S. It's only available in the U.S. It's not available here in Canada. In [[24:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1466)] Canada, we just don't allow it. If you look at the under 13 experience in the U.S., it's much more [[24:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1471)] restricted than the under 14 experience in China. It's so restrictive that every single piece of content is vetted by [[24:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1479)] our third-party child safety expert, and we don't allow any under 13s in the U.S. to publish. We don't [[24:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1488)] allow them to post, and we don't allow them to use a lot of features. So, I think that, that [[24:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1492)] report—I've seen that report too—it's not doing a fair comparison.

[#P039] [[24:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1496)] **Chris Anderson**: What do you make of this issue, [[24:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1498)] you know, in a lot of your... you've got these millions of content creators, and all of them, in a sense, [[25:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1502)] are in a race for attention. And that race can pull them in certain directions. So, for example, teenage [[25:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1511)] girls on TikTok. Sometimes people worry that to win attention, they've discovered that by being more sexual that [[25:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1518)] they can gain extra viewers. Is this a concern? Is there anything you can do about this?

[#P040] [[25:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1522)] **Shou Chew**: We address [[25:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1524)] this in our Community Guidelines as well. You know, if you look at the sexualized content on [[25:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1531)] our guidelines, if you're below a certain age, for certain themes that are mature, we actually remove [[25:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1537)] that from your experience. Again, I come back to this. We want to have a safe platform. In [[25:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1543)] fact, at my congressional hearing, I made four commitments to our users and to the politicians in the U.S. And [[25:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1549)] one of the first one is that we take safety, especially for teenagers, extremely seriously, and we will continue to [[25:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1555)] prioritize that. You know, I believe that we need to give our teenage users and our users in general a [[26:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1562)] very safe experience because if we don't do that, then we cannot... the mission is to inspire creativity and to [[26:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1567)] bring joy, right? If they don't feel safe, I cannot fulfill my mission. So, it's all very organic to [[26:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1573)] me as a business to make sure I do that.

[#P041] [[26:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1574)] **Chris Anderson**: But in the strange interacting world of human psychology, and [[26:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1579)] so forth, weird memes can take off. I mean, you had this outbreak a couple years back of these "devious [[26:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1584)] licks" where kids were competing with each other to do vandalism in schools and get lots of followers [[26:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1590)] from it. How on Earth do you battle something like that?

[#P042] [[26:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1594)] **Shou Chew**: Dangerous challenges are not allowed on our [[26:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1596)] platform. It's, if you look at our guidelines, it's violative. We proactively invest resources to identify them and [[26:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1603)] remove them from our platform. In fact, if you search for dangerous challenges on our platform today, we will redirect [[26:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1609)] you to a safety resource page. And we actually worked with some creators as well to come up with campaigns, [[26:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1614)] and this is another campaign, it's the "Stop, Think, Decide Before You Act" campaign, where we work with the creators [[27:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1620)] to produce videos to explain to people that some of things are dangerous, please don't do it. And we post [[27:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1626)] those videos actively on our platform as well.

[#P043] [[27:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1628)] **Chris Anderson**: That's cool. And you've got, you've got lots of employees. [[27:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1632)] I mean, how many employees do you have who are specifically looking at these content moderation things? Or is that [[27:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1639)] the wrong question? Are they mostly identified by AI initially, and then you have a group [[27:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1644)] who are overseeing and making the final decision?

[#P044] [[27:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1646)] **Shou Chew**: The group is based in Ireland, and it's a [[27:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1650)] lot of people. It's tens of thousands of people. Tens of, tens of thousands. It's a huge, it's one of [[27:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1655)] the most important cost items of my P&L, and I think it's completely worth it. Now, most of the [[27:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1660)] moderation has to be done by machines. The machines are good, they're quite good, but they're not as good as, [[27:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1666)] you know, they're not perfect at this point. So, you have to complement them with a lot of human beings [[27:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1671)] today. And I think, by the way, a lot of the progress in AI in general is making that kind [[27:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1677)] of content moderation capabilities a lot better. So, we're going to get more precise, we're going to get more [[28:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1683)] specific, and it's going to be able to handle larger scale, and that's something [[28:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1689)] that I'm personally looking forward to.

[#P045] [[28:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1690)] **Chris Anderson**: What about this perceived huge downside of use of certainly [[28:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1700)] Instagram, I think TikTok as well, where people worry that you are amplifying insecurities, especially of teenagers, and [[28:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1707)] perhaps especially teenage girls. That you see, they see these amazing people on there doing amazing things, they feel inadequate. [[28:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1714)] There's all these reported cases of depression, insecurity, suicide, and so forth.

[#P046] [[28:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1718)] **Shou Chew**: I take this extremely seriously. [[28:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1722)] So, again, in our guidelines, for certain themes that we think are mature [[28:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1730)] and not suitable for teenagers, we actually proactively remove it from their experience. At the same time, if you search certain terms, we will make [[28:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1737)] sure that you get redirected to a resource safety page. Now, we're always working with experts to understand some of [[29:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1744)] these new trends that could emerge and proactively try to manage and try to manage them, if that makes sense. [[29:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1750)] Now, this is a problem that predates us. It predates TikTok. It actually predates the internet. [[29:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1756)] But it's our responsibility to make sure that we invest enough to understand and to address the concerns to [[29:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1762)] keep the experience as safe as possible for as many people as possible.

[#P047] [[29:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1765)] **Chris Anderson**: Now, in Congress, the main concern [[29:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1768)] seemed to be not so much what we've talked about, but data—the data of users, the fact that [[29:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1774)] you're owned by ByteDance, Chinese company, and the concern that at any moment [[29:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1782)] Chinese government might require or ask for data. And in fact, there have been instances where I think you've confirmed that some data [[29:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1788)] of journalists on the platform was made available to ByteDance's engineers, and from there, who knows what? [[29:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1795)] Now, your response to this was to have this Project Texas, where you're moving data to be [[30:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1803)] controlled by Oracle here in the U.S. Can you talk about that project, and why, [[30:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1809)] if you believe it, why we should not worry so much about this issue?

[#P048] [[30:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1812)] **Shou Chew**: I will say a couple [[30:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1814)] of things about this, if you don't mind. The first thing I would say is that the internet is built [[30:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1819)] on global interoperability, and we are not the only company that relies on a global talent pool to make our [[30:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1825)] products as good as technology is a very collaborative effort. I think many people here would say the [[30:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1831)] same thing. So, we are not the first company to have engineers in all countries, including in China. We're not [[30:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1836)] the first one. Now, I understand some of these concerns. So, the data access by employees is not [[30:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1844)] data accessed by government. This is very different, and there's a clear difference in this. But we hear the concerns [[30:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1849)] that are raised in the United States. We did not try to avoid discussing, or we did not [[30:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1855)] try to argue our way out of it. What we did was, we built an unprecedented project where we localized [[31:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1861)] American data to be stored on American soil by an American company, overseen by American personnel. So, this [[31:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1869)] kind of protection for American data is beyond what any other company in our industry has ever done. It's [[31:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1877)] well, money is not the only issue here, but it's very expensive to build something like that. And more importantly, [[31:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1883)] we are basically localizing data in a way that no other company has done. So, we need to be [[31:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1889)] very careful that whilst we are pursuing data, what we call digital sovereignty in the U.S., and we're also doing [[31:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1896)] a version of this in Europe, that we don't balkanize the internet. Now, we are the first to do it, [[31:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1901)] and I expect that other companies are probably looking at this and trying to figure out how you [[31:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1906)] balance between protecting protected data, to make sure that everybody feels secure about it, while at the same [[31:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1913)] time allowing for interoperability to continue to happen because that's what makes technology and the internet so great. That's something [[32:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1920)] that we are.

[#P049] [[32:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1920)] **Chris Anderson**: How far are you along that journey with Project Texas?

[#P050] [[32:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1924)] **Shou Chew**: We are very, very far along today. [[32:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1925)] When, when, when will there be a clear, you know, "Here it is, it's done." [[32:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1931)] All new U.S. data is already stored in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. So, it's in [[32:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1939)] this protected U.S. environment that we talked about. In the United States, we still have some legacy data to delete [[32:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1945)] in our own servers in Virginia and in Singapore. Our data has never been stored in China, by the [[32:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1950)] way. That deletion is a very big engineering effort, so as I said at the hearing, it's [[32:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1956)] going to take us a while to delete them, but I expect it to be [[32:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1959)] done this year.

[#P051] [[32:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1967)] **Chris Anderson**: How much power do you have over your own ability to control certain things? So, for [[32:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1970)] for example, suppose that for whatever reason the Chinese government was to look at an upcoming U.S. election and say, [[32:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1977)] "you know what, we would like this party to win," let's say, or "we would like civil war to break [[33:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1983)] out," or whatever. And we could do this by amplifying the content of certain troublemaking, disturbing people, causing uncertainty, [[33:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=1993)] spreading misinformation, etc. Were you required via ByteDance to do this? Is there [[33:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2002)] a pathway where theoretically that's possible? What's your personal line in the sand [[33:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2009)] on this?

[#P052] [[33:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2010)] **Shou Chew**: So, during the congressional hearing I made four commitments. We talked about the first one, [[33:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2015)] which is safety. The third one is to keep TikTok a place of freedom of expression. By the way, [[33:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2020)] if you go on TikTok today, you can search for anything you want as long as it doesn't violate [[33:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2024)] our Community Guidelines, and to keep it free from any government manipulation. And the fourth one is transparency and third-party [[33:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2032)] monitoring. So, the way we are trying to address this concern is an unprecedented amount of transparency. What do I [[33:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2038)] mean by this? We're actually allowing third-party reviewers to come in and review our source code. I don't know any [[34:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2045)] other company that does this, by the way, just so because everything, as you know, is driven by code. [[34:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2050)] So, to allow someone else to review the source code is to give this a significant amount of transparency to [[34:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2057)] ensure that the design areas that you described, this highly hypothetical, cannot happen on our platform. Now, at the same [[34:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2063)] time, we are releasing more research tools for researchers so that they can study the output. So, you know, the [[34:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2070)] source code is the input. We are also allowing researchers to study the output, which is the content on our [[34:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2075)] platform. I think the easiest way to sort of defend this is transparency. We give people access [[34:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2082)] to to monitor us, and we can just make it very, very transparent, and that's our approach to the problem.

[#P053] [[34:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2085)] **Chris Anderson**: So, you will say directly to this group that the scenario I talked about of theoretical Chinese government [[34:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2094)] interference in an American election, you can say that will not happen.

[#P054] [[34:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2097)] **Shou Chew**: I can say that we are building all [[35:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2101)] the tools to prevent any of these actions from happening. And I'm very confident that with an unprecedented [[35:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2108)] amount of transparency that we're giving on the platform, we can reduce this risk to as low [[35:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2115)] as zero as possible.

[#P055] [[35:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2118)] **Chris Anderson**: To as low as zero as possible.

[#P056] [[35:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2121)] **Shou Chew**: To as close to zero as possible.

[#P057] [[35:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2123)] **Chris Anderson**: As close [[35:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2123)] to zero as possible. That's fairly reassuring. Fairly. [[35:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2132)] I mean, how would the world know? And what would, like, if you discovered this or you thought you had [[35:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2136)] to do it, is this a line in the sand for you? Like, are you at a situation, [[35:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2142)] you would not let the company that you know now and that you are running do this?

[#P058] [[35:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2145)] **Shou Chew**: Absolutely. That's the [[35:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2147)] reason why we're letting third parties monitor them, because if they find out, they will disclose this. [[35:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2152)] We also have transparency reports, by the way, where we talk about a whole bunch of things, the [[35:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2157)] content that we remove, that violates our guidelines, government requests. It's all published online. All you [[36:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2163)] have to do is search for it.

[#P059] [[36:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2165)] **Chris Anderson**: So, you're super compelling and likable as a CEO, I have to say. [[36:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2168)] And I would like to, as we wrap this up, I'd like to give you a chance just to [[36:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2172)] paint, like, what's the vision? As you look at what TikTok could be, let's move the clock [[36:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2179)] out, say, five, five years from now. How should we think about your contribution to our collective future?

[#P060] [[36:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2185)] **Shou Chew**: I think it's still down to the vision that we have. So, in terms of the window of discovery, I think [[36:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2192)] there's a huge benefit to the world when people can discover new things. You know, people think that TikTok [[36:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2198)] is all about dancing and singing, and there's nothing wrong with that because it's super fun. There's still a lot [[36:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2203)] of that, but we're seeing science content, STEM content. Have you heard about "BookTok"? It's a [[36:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2209)] viral trend that talks about books and encourages people to read. That "BookTok" has 120 billion views globally. 120 [[36:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2218)] billion, billion with a B. People are learning how to cook. People are learning about science. People [[37:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2223)] are learning how to golf. Well, people are watching videos on golfing, I guess. I haven't gotten better. [[37:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2233)] And I think there's a huge opportunity here on discovery and giving the everyday person a voice. If you talk to our [[37:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2239)] creators, a lot of people will tell you this again and again, that before TikTok, they [[37:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2244)] would never have been discovered, and we have given them the platform to do that. It's important to maintain that. [[37:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2249)] We talk about creation. There's all these new technology coming in with AI generative content that [[37:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2256)] will help people create even more creative content. I think there's going to be a collaboration between—and I [[37:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2262)] think there's a speaker who's going to talk about this—people and AI, where they can unleash their creativity [[37:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2268)] in a different way. Like, for example, I'm terrible at drawing personally, but if I had somebody [[37:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2274)] to help me, then maybe I can express myself even better. Then we talk about bridges to connect, [[37:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2279)] and connecting people in the communities together. This could be products, this could be commerce. 5 million small [[38:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2286)] businesses in the U.S. benefit from TikTok today. I think we can get that number to a much [[38:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2291)] higher number, and of course, if you look around the world, including in Canada, that number is going to be [[38:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2295)] massive. So, I think these are the biggest opportunities that we have, and it's really very exciting.

[#P061] [[38:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2296)] **Chris Anderson**: So, courtesy [[38:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2302)] of your experience in Congress, you actually became a bit of a TikTok star yourself, I think. Some [[38:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2309)] of your videos have gone viral. How about, you've got your phone with you, little TikTok video right now?

[#P062] [[38:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2315)] **Shou Chew**: If the audience doesn't do this, if you don't mind, we're just going to do a selfie together. How's that? [[38:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2320)] Okay, so why don't we just say, "Hi, hi, hello from TED!" All right, thank you. I hope it goes [[38:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2330)] viral.

[#P063] [[38:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2330)] **Chris Anderson**: If that one goes viral, I think I've given up on your algorithm, actually. I think it's going to, it's [[38:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2337)] going to take better. You're one of the most influential and powerful people in the world, whether you know it [[39:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2345)] or not, and I really appreciate you coming and sharing your vision. I really, really hope the upside of what [[39:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zC8-06198g&t=2350)] you're talking about comes about. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank.
