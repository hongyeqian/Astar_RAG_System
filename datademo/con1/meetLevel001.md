# **Meeting: Build 2025 — Grok on Azure**

### Meeting Purpose

- Discuss collaboration between **Microsoft (ORG1)** and **xAI (ORG2)** around deploying *Grok* models on **Azure**.
- Explore AI reasoning grounded in physics and real-world applications.
- Encourage developer community feedback to guide iterative improvement of Grok.

### Acronyms & Orgs (Normalized)

- **ORG1** — Microsoft
- **ORG2** — xAI (Elon Musk’s organization)
- **ORG3** — Tesla / SpaceX (referenced as internal Grok users)

### Capability Highlights (by org)

- **ORG1 (Microsoft)**
  - Hosting *Grok* family of models on Azure.
  - Enabling multi-model orchestration and agent-based AI systems.
- **ORG2 (xAI)**
  - Developing *Grok 3.5*, focusing on reasoning from first principles.
  - Emphasis on AI safety via “truth with minimal error” and fast correction loops.
  - Integrating Grok across xAI, Tesla, SpaceX, and X for grounded real-world deployment.
- **ORG3 (Tesla / SpaceX)**
  - Using Grok for robotics, FSD (Full Self-Driving), and customer service systems.

### Current Projects / Workstreams

- **Grok 3.5 Release:** Advanced reasoning model leveraging physics-based logic.
- **Azure Deployment:** Integrating Grok into Microsoft’s Azure ecosystem for developers.
- **Cross-Domain Applications:** Applying Grok to robotics, vehicles, and customer service AI.

### Overlaps vs. Unique Contributions

- **Overlaps:**
  - Shared interest in AI reasoning safety and real-world grounding.
  - Collaborative focus on developer ecosystem and feedback-driven iteration.
- **Unique:**
  - **ORG1:** Cloud orchestration, developer access, multi-agent infrastructure.
  - **ORG2:** Model design, physics-based reasoning, and deployment in autonomous systems.

### Proposed Collaboration Path

- **Fast Track:**
  - Launch Grok on Azure; gather real-world developer feedback (developers as early testers).
- **Research Track:**
  - Continue refining physics-grounded AI reasoning and feedback correction mechanisms.

### Decisions (timestamps enabled)

- **[00:43]** Jointly announce *Grok* deployment on Azure for developer access.
- **[06:00]** Commit to merging real-world models (vision, language, action) grounded in physics.

### Risks / Open Issues

- **AI Safety:** Ensuring minimal reasoning error while scaling Grok’s capabilities.
- **Feedback Loop Dependence:** Reliance on developer feedback to refine accuracy and safety.

### Action Items

-  **Collect developer feedback** on Grok performance and usability — *ORG1 & ORG2* (Due: TBD)
-  **Coordinate Azure rollout plan** for Grok 3.5 with xAI team — *ORG1* (Due: TBD)
-  **Integrate Grok into SpaceX/Tesla operations** for expanded grounding validation — *ORG3* (Due: TBD)
